      "One of the reasons people are saying the writing is not neat is because your e should not extend below the line. You are writing e like a backwards g, and it makes your writing look jagged and childish, since there are so many e's in the language.\n\nFor example, look at your written word college, then compare it to what I just typed. The only letter that should extend below the line is g. Similarly, the only letters that should be taller than the others is L (written as a capital here so you can tell it apart from i easier).\n\nFix the e, and your handwriting will improve a ton."

      "I would say 'looks like it's going to rain' or 'looks like it's gonna rain.' I haven't heard people say it without the 'going to' or 'gonna' very often ('it looks like rain'). I might also say 'Looks like it's gonna be rainy today' or something like that. I don't think there's a most common, but this type of phrasing is plenty common and you'll hear it almost everywhere (at least in the US)",

      "A storms a comin'. I can feel it in m' bones.\n\n\nIt is a little cliche to say the phrase you gave, but it is totally fine to say.",

      "I'd probably say \"looks like it'll rain\" or \"looks like its gonna (going to) rain\" rather than \"looks like rain\"",
      "Yep, that has become so idiomatic it's almost ritualistic. Many of us probably don't even try to form a new sentence for that idea--\"looks like rain\" just comes out of our mouths. The only reason we might not say that is if the weather was just part of some larger \"story\". \"Well, looks like it's gonna rain, so I'd better get these tools back into the shed.\" But if you were just expressing the simple idea that the weather patterns indicated impending rain, then you' say \"looks like rain\". If two buddies were just hanging out at a campsite or on the back deck, and the clouds indicated rain soon, and there was a lull in the conversation, you'd probably be surprised if someone didn't say \"looks like rain\".",
      "It's acceptable. Personally I tend to say \"smells like rain's coming\", because I consider the smell of rain to be a more reliable indicator than the appearance of the clouds.",
      "Yea, but pretty much only in the exact scenario you described.",
      "Also common, at least in the Midwest, is ‚Äúthink it‚Äôs gonna rain?‚Äù The proper response is grunt or say ‚Äúwell‚Ä¶‚Äù and not follow it up with anything"

If you‚Äôre learning English, not a bad source to learn from.\n\n¬†It‚Äôs hard to tell how he naturally speaks but there are a few things that seem midwestern to me. He has a really neutral r sound, (whereas northeast tends to be softer, northwest tends to be harsher, and southeast more drawn out) a somewhat overemphasized s sound, not a lot of glottal stops. He seems like he‚Äôs not moving his mouth very much and kind of skips over the middles of long words (pronouncing movement like mooment.) He has a fair amount of vocal fry which is sometimes stereotyped as a California thing but I think is just increasingly a normal way to speak across the country.¬†",
      "Hard to tell. Not southern not northeastern not upper midwest. I'd say west coast somewhere, but that's very tentative. I'm not sure if he's exaggerating his enunciation or if he has lisp-ish tendencies. Not the standard lisp that people think of, but I lump all sorts of non-standard mouth shapes into the term \"lisp\". An actual vocal expert could give better terms. His \"s\" and \"th\" sounds are what I would consider irregular. He says \"da\" (approximately) instead of \"the\" and \"dat\" instead of \"that\". His \"s\" sounds are clipped: \"becuss\" for \"because\" (which \"should\" sound more like \"becuz\"). Maybe he immigrated, so maybe he's near the border. Southern California, Arizona, New Mexico. IDK. Are you testing us and you know the answer, or were you just curious?",

      "Sounds to me like West Coast, up North... perhaps Seattle-ish region. Just a guess. \n\nSomeone track this dude down and let us know lol!",
      "If I had to guess, I'd say inland California, but his accent is pretty neutral. Maybe he moved around a lot as a kid and made new friends by smoking weed with them.",
      "Fairly neutral and not immediately placeable. I occasionally hear a subtle d instead of th (especially in the video linked in subthread) which makes me think a lower midwestern or specifically Chicago accent is underneath there, but it‚Äôs not really obvious.",
      "It seems Southern. For me it's the way that he says 'pitch' kind of musically and his general speaking is a bit gravelly. I can't really place what state specifically, but I'll say the South or Southern Eastern Seaboard.",
      "Doesn't sound \"neutral\"; sounds American.",

      "I would say I have a good ear for accents in English, but I think most English speakers would understand every word you said there. As you mentioned, there is some improvement needed in the fluidity, but that comes with time and practice, when you no longer need to think of which word comes next‚Äî I‚Äôm the same way in French right now. One thing about your pronunciation, and this is a very common thing for Italian speakers, is words ending in consonants. Many Italians tend to add a ‚Äúuh‚Äù sound at the end of words, which I wouldn‚Äôt know how difficult it is to stop, but that‚Äôs one thing I definitely noticed. Other than that, your grammar was good like 95% of the time, and your t‚Äôs and r‚Äôs and overall stress/articulation are clear and mimic the American accent well.",
      "You were very understandable for the most part. There was only one word I couldn‚Äôt understand. It was right before you asked for advices.

I think your accent sounds noticeably closer to the American pronunciation of words than the British versions but I‚Äôm curious what other people would think. You are definitely fluent but I think you maybe talk a bit slower than a native speaker but that would naturally improve the more you talk in English. Anyone who speaks English in America would understand you tho",

Also, I heard a few words/ grammar errors, such as at 1:37: it should be ‚Äúdo incorrectly‚Äù instead of wrongly and right after fluidity near 1:48, it ‚Äústill needs ‚Äú with an s at the end.

    "text": "‚ÄúChinese‚Äù can‚Äôt take a possessive  ‚Äô. But ‚ÄúAmerican‚Äù can take a possessive ‚Äòs.  Right?",
    "comments": [
      "Two notes:\n\n*Chinese*, when used as a plural noun like *Americans*, must be preceded by *the*: *the Chinese*. This is because it is an adnoun, an adjective used as a noun, and that's how adnouns are used in English. (However, in your instance *Chinese people* would more likely be used.)\n\nThe possessive *-'*, with no *s* written, is only used after words ending in the letter *s*, not simply the /s/ or /z/ sound. So you can write *Thomas'* or *Thomas's* (either way is fine), but not *Chinese'*; it must be *Chinese's*.\n\nSo your sentence would need to be: \"Is the Chinese's English good?\"\n\nThat is grammatically correct, but not something you're likely to hear someone actually say. Much more likely would be: \"Do Chinese people (tend to) have good English?\"",
      "No, that sentence makes no sense and you can't just add an apostrophe to the end of a word without an S to make it possessive.\n\nYou also cannot refer to the entire population of Chinese people's ability to speak English that way, it's nonsense.",
      "You could ask, ‚ÄúIs the American‚Äôs English good,‚Äù as in, ‚ÄúDoes that American person speak English well?‚Äù However, for a Chinese person, you would have to ask ‚ÄúIs that Chinese person‚Äôs English good,‚Äù not ‚ÄúIs that Chinese‚Äôs English good?‚Äù Calling a Chinese person a Chinese sounds both wrong and a bit like a slur to native ears.",
      "As an example, let‚Äôs replace the word ‚ÄúChinese‚Äô ‚Äú with ‚ÄúEnglish‚Äôs ‚Äù in this sentence, since the word English also refers to people from England. \n\n\n‚ÄúIs English‚Äôs English good?‚Äù just doesn‚Äôt make a lot of sense, and neither does ‚ÄúIs the English‚Äôs English good?‚Äù. It‚Äôs a very vague question.",
      "‚ÄúChinese‚Äù can take a possessive when it is used as a noun. Using non-European adjectives as nouns is typically considered impolite today, and so I would recommend treating Chinese as an adjective and including a noun. Example: ‚ÄúIs the Chinese student‚Äôs English good?‚Äù \n\nThere are a few exceptions where it is less impolite (or at least more common), including Mexican and German, but as a general rule include the noun. In older texts you may see someone referred to as ‚Äúa Chinese.‚Äù Avoid this. \n\nThe one instance I can think of where Chinese could take a possessive is when the possessive noun is removed. For example: ‚ÄúThe Americans‚Äô style of cooking is much different than the Chinese‚Äôs [style of cooking].‚Äù This is a rare construction you do not need to worry about.",
      "Simple and short answer because I think it might be helpful: \n\nYes, it's wrong. The best way to express this is \"Are Chinese people (usually) good at English?\"",
      "Why is there an apostrophe after the word Chinese?",
      "[deleted]",
      "A caveat here is that you can say, ‚ÄúDo the Chinese speak English well,‚Äù or, ‚ÄúDoes Chinese people speak English well,‚Äùwith reference to the entire ethnic group. In that case, you don‚Äôt need a possessive.",
      "because they're trying to figure out if a particular English rule also applies to \"Chinese\" where a word has a sounding 's' at the end but doesn't end with an 's'. So the question is, is it Chinese' or Chinese's?\n\nFor example: \n\ngoose = \"the goose's feathers\" not \"the goose' feathers\"",

      "Other commenters have explained what's going on here with \"still\" in that lyric, but I'd like to add an extra thing I noticed about it. If the words were rearranged into \"But *you're still* in my way,\" it makes as much sense as the original \"But *still, you're* in my way.\"\n\nHowever, putting \"still\" first so that it's not part of the \"you're in my way\" phrase puts extra emphasis onto it, which results in the \"in spite of/despite\" extra meaning. Not only are \"you\" still in the singer's way (so, \"you\" were there already and have refused to move), but \"you're\" there even *despite* \"taking your time with the call\" and \"giving \"nothin' at all.\" In spite of being the one who messed up, \"you\" are now acting like everything can be fixed if the singer just gives in and lets \"you\" win.\n\nDespite everything, \"you're\" still here.",
      "I think that what's complicating this for us is the placement of the word \"still.\"  It seems clearer to me if we were to, just temporarily, move it to \"But, you're still in my way.\"  To me, it seems like an adverb meaning \"continuing through the moment in question.\"\nI think the reason it's given to mean \"despite\" is that it can be meant to imply it by virtue of a condition or fact remaining to be true, sometimes against the odds.",
      "‚ÄúIn spite of‚Äù and ‚Äúdespite‚Äù are synonyms. They mean almost exactly the same thing.¬†\n\nYes, there‚Äôs nuanced situations where it‚Äôs more common to use on than the other, but that‚Äôs true of all synonyms.¬†",

      "\"What great creations kids make\" is sarcasm, implying that the \"creations\" in the picture below the text are the opposite of great.\n\nAlso note: your question should ask \"what does this meme mean?\"",
      "It‚Äôs sarcasm. \nWhat great creations kids make.\nAs we can see the creations are made by adults as seen in the age section and the creations are just one block connected to nothing.

In English you can use it like this to make an exclamation.\n\n\"What a wonderful day it is!\"\n\n\"What great things kids make!\"\n\nYou can tell that these aren't questions because there are several things these sentences need to become questions. That could be word order, the lack of \"do'', etc. \n\nI don't blame you for not getting the joke, despite you getting all those dozens of downvotes. If there's even the slightest thing that trips you up in the grammar of the joke, or the meaning isn't crystal clear to you, that can take away almost all of the punchline.

This can be either a clever way of saying you created something by doing no actual work or a lack of creativity depending on how you look at it.\n\nThe image below it is from the movie \"The Zoolander\" and is most likely a gif showing two characters walking by each other. The two characters are rivals, and threatened by one another despite doing essentially the exact same thing. The gif most likely shows the name Will and Mark above each mirroring the idea that Will and Mark have the same idea and could theoretically be threatened by one another.\n\nI know this isn't \"Explain the Joke\" but I felt the need...",

So we can be close, but not close enough to crash.\n\nHowever, I believe we all want to get that zero distance thing with someone without crashing.\n\nThe good news is WE CAN GET IT.\n\nBut it's up to us, what do we want to believe,\nDo we want to believe that gravity (attraction) is a force as Newton said?\nor an effect as Einstein stated?\n\nIf we say force, there's a big possibility of crashing if it wasn't controlled.\nIf we say effect, there's a potential to merge together.\n\nHonestly, if human relationships were to be an equation, it doesn't have to be the gravity equation or any other equation. We can create a new one just for us, if we want.\n\nOR\nWe can just imagine that we are two galaxies.

While reading, write down words or phrases you come across that you don't know and once you finish a chapter, go back and make flash cards for anki or something similar out of those words and phrases and study them. I'm studying Norwegian and this has been a helpful method for learning less common words and phrasing that goes against what I'm used to seeing. Sometimes words I know are used in ways I haven't seen before when I'm reading so it is helpful because you get more exposure to how words are used.",
      "Use an app that forces you to recall vocabulary so you can expand beyond the most frequently used words. I use Anki.",

But the other suggestion is very good. That said, if you can't put in the effort to find some suitable reading material, you probably aren't going to learn the vocabulary either. You need to find stuff you like, at a reasonable level, and that is accessible to you.",

      "If you have access to a library with a lot of English books and want to find out what your reading level is like, I'd recommend that you spend an hour or so in the library and start by reading a couple pages of a children's book, if you find that too easy, move up a bit in difficulty and read a couple pages. Repeat the process until you have a book that may require you to think in order to figure out the meaning once or twice in those couple pages and for a minute or two each time, but overall isn't super frequent and doesn't take too long to figure out.\n\nIf you're wanting suggestions on specific books to start with and progress towards, I'd probably go something along the lines of: Dr. Seuss > Charlotte's Web > The Outsiders > The Hunger Games > Animal Farm.\n\nAnother great option would be if there are any science or history books and/or textbooks in the non-fiction section that are labeled to be for readers within specific age ranges.",

Also, what types of things do you normally like to read? Fantasy and science fiction will often be a lot more difficult for someone learning since there are so many made-up words and fancy description words. Keep that in mind as you test out books. \n\nI'm more than happy to give recommendations based on what types of things you like to read, but it would definitely be helpful to have a better idea of the level you currently could read at, so I think following UnholyBaroness's steps to find your reading level is a great start! Feel free to message me if you need more guidance.",
      "I'd just like to quickly add on to something you said: Fantasy and science fiction having a lot of made-up words is (in my opinion) a great reason to read them once you're around the reading level of The Hunger Games.

    "text": "In Taylor Swift's Shake It Off, What does the word \"out\" mean ?",
    "comments": [
      "‚ÄúDown and out‚Äù is an idiom. Usually it‚Äôs used to mean someone who is having a tough time because they‚Äôre poor or having bad luck‚Äîthey‚Äôre down (sad) and out (without possessions/a home). It can also mean feeling upset or sad in life, which is what she means here. She chose this phrase because it mirrors the next line ‚Äúgetting down‚Äù meaning to dance.\n\n‚ÄúJust think, while you‚Äôve been spending time upset about the liars and the dirty cheats of the world, you could have been dancing.‚Äù",
      "\"While you've been feeling down\" would have meant the same thing here here. 'While youve been getting down' without the 'and out' could have been confusing because often \"get down\" in music refers to dancing, so she may have said getting down and out to differentiate it from that. Maybe she chose down and out because it was longer and she felt it fit better with the rhythm in the song, or maybe she chose it because it's more natural to how she talks. But yeah it's¬† a slightly unconventional way to say it.",
      "Why\\* does she say",
      "\"Down and out\" means poor, or living in rough circumstances. I'm not familiar with Swift's music. I'm reading that lyric for the first time. Honestly, it sounds kinda awkward to me, because I don't usually think of \"getting down and out\", just \"being down and out\". From context, it sounds less like poverty and more like  emotional distress or disappointment. You've been letting the liars and cheats get to you, letting them make you upset, and instead you could feel better by listening to this music.\n\nMaybe there's a different meaning, or maybe I'm missing context.",
      "Lots of good answers but please keep in mind that grammar \"rules\" barely keep spoken English in check, when it comes to art we pretty much accept that grammatical rules and convention are entirely optional",

'do' accompanies verbs, and stuck is not a verb. 'There was an urgent' is SUPER wrong - urgent is an adjective, and here you should be using the noun form 'urgency'. \n\nSome things need to be explained in your native language, depending on your level. The good news is that this basic grammar stuff is actually pretty easy to understand.",

It's a shame to see myself making so many basic grammar mistakes, but I hope to improve soon.\n\nHere is the revised version:\n\n**Why am I stuck at an intermediate level**\n\n\"It is because you feel comfortable, no urgency to go further.\" I learnt it from a YouTube video yesterday, and I could not agree more.\n\nThere was an urgent back four years ago, which helped me move from a beginner level to an intermediate level. It happened when I was looking for new job opportunities. Speaking English fluently would be beneficial to interviews, so I carried out a detailed plan and gave myself 2 months to prepare. I spent at least 30 minutes training my accent every day combined with massive listening training. I also attended a public speaking meetup every Saturday. The improvement was so obvious, and I finally got an offer.\n\nIn the past four years, with an intermediate level, I did not have big problems to deal with daily affairs. As a software developer, my level is also enough to communicate at the office. I know it would be even better if I could use English more freely, but there is no such urgency, I just leave it as it is. I get stuck here.\n\nSo why do I force myself to continue again? Yes, I use \"force\" here, I have to be honest: I do not enjoy this progress. I want to continue to climb the career ladder. I am looking for engineering manager or tech lead roles this time. High skill at comminution, not only speaking, but also writing, becomes so critical and it is also required.",

Even using eradicate like \"I will eradicate unemployment\" feels incorrect as it's a bit more grave and serious than the sentence calls for.\n\nI generally don't understand the sentence, \"However, the weakness of workforce qualifications plays a big firewall here.\" I've only ever seen \"firewall\" be used in discussions about digital security. ‚ÄãHurdle, roadblock, or obstacle would be better, i.e. \"The lack of skilled workers is a massive roadblock.\" Alternatively, you could rephrase the entire sentence with 'barrier to entry' like so: \"The barrier to entry for most jobs is too high.\"\n\n‚Äì \"Wipe out\" feels like a strange word choice here. It implies total eradication, but doesn't suit this topic. Perhaps \"shoot down\" would sound better?\n\n‚Äì Is \"quitely\" your use of \"acquit\" for this sentence, or did you mean \"quietly?\"‚Äã\n\n‚Äì Rehabilitate tends to be applied to a single entity, i.e. rehabilitating a sick animal, or rehabilitating a criminal.

      "It might could be acceptable in certain parts of the Southern US, but elsewhere it is likely to cause confusion and be declared wrong.\n\nhttps://eleanorabraham.com/2017/08/19/getting-very-angry-about-grammar/",
      "This is highly specific to certain areas of the United States, so unless you‚Äôre living there for a good while ‚Äî long enough to pick up their peculiarities of speech ‚Äî please avoid the ‚Äòmight could‚Äô type of construction.\n\nIt‚Äôs a real charmer, though!",
      "Piling up auxiliaries of different types is fine, just not with modals. But it does happen...\n\n\nhttps://ygdp.yale.edu/phenomena/multiple-modals#who-says-this",
      "It's incorrect because, well, it is. Modals cannot be used together like this in standard English. I'm pretty sure there are dialects that use it though.",
      "It could be understand which means \"I might be able to help you\" but with more uncertainty. Standard English may rejects it because it's not following the actual grammar rule.",
      "It is also inappropriate.  \nIn this sentence, the modals indicate possibility / probability.  \n‚ÄúI might‚Äù indicates something is unlikely.  \n‚ÄúI could‚Äù indicates something is possible.  \nSaying that something is unlikely implies that it is possible, so there is no need for ‚Äòcould‚Äô in the sentence.  \n\nIn practice, native speakers use a combination of modals and adverbs to ‚Äòfine tune‚Äô expressions of possibility / probability:\n\nI might just help you. = it is highly unlikely.  \nI could well help you = it is very possible.  \n\nOr, use idiomatic expressions:\n\n‚ÄúIt‚Äôs a long shot‚Äù\n‚ÄúThe odds are against‚Äù\n‚ÄúThere‚Äôs a good chance.‚Äù\n‚ÄúNot a hope in hell.‚Äù\n\nSo, such a phrase not only breaks one of the fundamental rules of modals, it is also unnecessary and there are many alternative ways to give the same information.",
      "I actually heard someone say \"might could\" in a movie once and got super confused because my textbook never mentioned it. Turns out, it is a thing in some Southern US dialects (like in parts of Texas or Appalachia)! It basically means the same as \"might be able to\" or \"could maybe\" in standard English.\n\nStandard grammar rules hate double modals (might + could), but languages are messy and dialects have their own logic. I low-key think it sounds kinda cool, even if I wouldn‚Äôt use it in an essay lol.",
      "To most people (including me), it's not clear what it's supposed to mean.¬† Part of the issue here is that English modal verbs don't generally have infinitives.",
      "this is wrong, I don't know of any place in the native english speaking world who would use this.",
      "In cheuchter Scots you'd maybe hear \"He'll can dae it the morn\" (He will be able to do it tomorrow)",
      "I grew up in Tennessee saying \"might could do\" and \"used to could do\" pretty easily. See also Flannery O'Connor's short story \"Everything that Rises Must Converge\" (O'Connor was from Georgia):\n\n>\"Can it get any hotter?\" she said and removed from her purse a folding fan, black with a Japanese scene on it, which she began to flutter before her.\n\n>\"**I reckon it might could**,\" the woman with the protruding teeth said, \"but I know for a fact my apartment couldn't get no hotter.\"\n\nI taught that story in a university classroom in Utah once, and read that passage aloud. When they heard it in my native accent, the class full of native English speakers seemed to understand the woman's line for the first time. So definitely regional usage‚Äîin fact, \"I reckon it might could\" might be the most southern sentence ever written.",
      "It sounds weird becuz you‚Äôre not supposed to stack modals like ‚Äúmight‚Äù and ‚Äúcould‚Äù together. Normally, it‚Äôs either ‚ÄúI might help you‚Äù or ‚ÄúI could help you.‚Äù This double modal construction is acceptable & quite common in some dialects of English in parts of the Southern US. People use it to be polite or a bit unsure, like ‚ÄúI might be able to help you‚Äù without sounding too direct.\n\nSo yeah, it‚Äôs not ‚Äúcorrect‚Äù in formal English, but totally fine and natural in certain regions. It basically means ‚Äúthere‚Äôs a chance I can help you,‚Äù just with a softer vibe.",
      "Unless you're in a very specific region, that sounds just wrong. But, what it would mean is just \"I could help you\".  There might be an implication that I need a little encouragement to help you. Sort of \"well, I \\*could\\* help you, but I'd be more inclined to help you if you gave me a swig of that nice whiskey I see over there\". Of course, none of that would actually be said. Body language and context do all of that work, all the speaker needs to say is \"I \\*might\\* could help you\".",
      "I've never heard it, nor heard of it. I can't tell you exactly why it's wrong because, as already mentioned, you can't really stack modals. I can't tell you why you can't do that, though - maybe it's just a rule.\n\nI don't know what I'd interpret that sentence as meaning, either. Ways to rewrite it aside, I think I'd lean towards interpreting it as both might and could - it is within the realm of possibility that you will try, *and* you are able to - but won't necessarily do so.",
      "Yeah, I once knew someone from the south who used this and I found it a charming idiosyncrasy."

      "It's just \"They left two years ago\".\n\n\"They have left\" would stand on its own as a full sentence, just meaning they have completed the act of leaving at some time in the past, but if you want to specify a timeframe it's \"They left two years ago\"\n\nIf this were narration (narrator speaking in first person since they already said \"They don't live here anymore\") it might be possible to say \"They had left two years ago.\", but if this was dialogue or you're actually speaking to someone that would be awkward and you'd just say \"They left two years ago.\".   The latter is more universal so that's probably the right answer.",
      "The answer here is just \"left\".\n\n\"Have left\" is used for something that is continuous in effect. \"The colder temperatures have left farmers with shorter growing seasons.\" \"The fugitives have left the country.\"",
      "When the time period is finished like: yesterday, last month, last year, ago, in 1999 or when \"when\" is used in a question, for example, when you want to know the exact time the action took place in the past. ------> use Past Simple\n\nWhen the time period is still open: this year, today, this morning (if it's still morning at the time of speaking), recently, lately, in the last few days/months/years, in questions with \"how long\" or \"since when\", also when the person is still alive and is talking about how many times certain things have happened in their life so far or that \"this is the first/second/fifth/etc time they have done something OR if the time is not even necessary since what really matters is the result (now! at the time of speaking) of something that happened in the past ------> use Present Perfect\n\nOr at least this is how I explain the usage of Present Perfect and Past Simple to my students",
      "Present perfect is hard to learn, and hard to teach. But here is a simple rule which is almost always true:\n\nIf the time period is finished (completed) you **cannot** use present perfect in that clause.",
      "\"Ago\" is an adverb of time to indicate a period of time that is completed.  It always refers to a past time therefore the tense must be past simple.  The correct answer is \"left\".\n\n\"Have left\" is past perfect and indicates a completed action.  There can be no reference to a past time.  They have left=they're not here anymore, they're gone, etc.  When they left (two years ago) doesn't matter and cannot be referred to.",
      "Left",
      "To add on, \"had left\" can also be correct depending on context, for example if you were telling a story in present tense.¬†",
      "It should be left‚Ä¶not have left. It is an action that has been completed as opposed to a continuing action.",
      "They left two years ago.",
      "If it helps, American English almost never uses ‚Äúhave‚Äù in relation to an action a person completed in the past.",
      "The adverb 'ago' has been used in the sentence. It indicates a completed event. We use the past simple tense for a completed event and not the present simple continuous tense.",
      "They left two years ago is correct. There are three typical verb forms for a verb, be it regular or irregular. Regular example is cook, cooked, cooked. Irregular go, went, gone. \nThe first form is the present. The second form is the past/definite time. The third form is with have/has (or had) and is indefinite time. \nTwo years ago is an expression of definite time. When? Two years ago, that's when. Indefinite time words are not definite: ever, never, often, seldom, rarely, etc.\nSo correctly you could say \"I have never left.\" Or I have often left early.\" \nBut to say I have left yesterday is incorrect because yesterday is a definite time. Correctly one would say so left yesterday. (The three forms of the verb are leave, left, left.)\n\nAnother form not yet mentioned is the passive. This combines the verb to be and the third form. Example: do, did, done. The work is done mainly by the clerks. \nAn example with leave, left, left. A book is always left on that desk. Awkwardly phrased, but an example.",
      "They left, as in a singular moment in the past.   \n\"Have left\" implies continuity of sort, like \"they have left(they are still leaving as we speak)‚Äù",
      "Left. You are discussing a thing that happened in the past from the present, as opposed to describing a past state caused by something even further in the past. Had left would follow after ‚ÄúThey didn‚Äôt live there anymore,‚Äù but since you‚Äôre talking about how they are currently, you just say they left."

However, as a nonnative English speaker, I often find it so hard to produce such well-constructed sentences as yours. Honestly, I do not have the ability to distinguish written English and spoken English; I often use whatever I can think of in either writing or speaking.\n\nAs I lack an English speaking environment to immerse in, is it a good idea to read books on how to distinguish spoken English from writing English to make up for a lack of an English speaking environment?",
      "Thank you very much for your reply! BTW Is \"do a process\" more often used in daily conversations than \"complete a process\" or \"undergo a process\"? Does \"complete a process\" or \"undergo a process\" sound more formal so that they are usually used in writing but could still be used by people such as teachers in classroom teaching?\n\nAs I lack an English speaking environment to immerse in, is it a good idea to read books on how to distinguish spoken English from writing English to make up for a lack of an English speaking environment?",

      "When taking your sentence literally, \"complete the process\" and \"do the process\" are both fairly common, whereas \"undergo\" is rarer. But substituting the word process for anything else, like homework, do is more common (i.e. \"did you do your homework?\") Complete and undergo are more formal, and I would personally use them when writing.\n\nAs always, talking to fluent English speakers is probably the best way to learn, and there comes a point in your learning where you won't figure out tone and formality unless you do. Books are still more formal than how people really talk.",

Would you please do this for me when you've got a minute?

Too good to be true, perhaps, but it's not just showing off. It warns us, from the start, that the first thing we must do is take our disbelief, hang it on the highest hook we can find, and leave it there: Dear Reader, here be wonders. And, having started at the top, Auster induces in us the vertigo of the title, throughout this endearing and always silkily readable picaresque, by his ear-popping changes of altitude: from the miraculous to the preposterous, exalted metaphor to gut comedy, from walking in the air to crawling in the mud, Keystone Cops to Pilgrim's Progress.!<\n\n>!The unlikely Pilgrim, here, is Walt, a fly and grubby urchin on the mean streets of 1930s St Louis, who is talent-spotted by the black-clad Master Yehudi - is he mage or conman? - and trained to walk on air. To enable him to achieve his obvious potential, however, the Master subjects him to a series of grotesque humiliations and tortures. It's a process of spiritual cleansing like that of some extreme mystic sect, and one that's impossible to credit, however high we hung our cynicism at the start. Never mind: one day, from the dog-depths of his despair and loneliness, Walt just takes off. A few inches at first, above the kitchen floor, then gradually a couple of faltering steps, then on to the full over-the-water.!<\n\n>!And they're off. A pair of showmen now, Walt the Wonder Boy and the Master bundle around in an old jalopy, raking in the pennies from gawping farmhands at country fairs. You can almost hear the ragtime on the soundtrack.!<\n\n>!Nemesis, or gravity's revenge, comes in two guises. There is wicked Uncle Slim, the cruel guardian who handed Walt over to a stranger without a qualm, but who returns for a share of the loot; he is a pantomime villain with real malice in his heart and real bullets in his gun. And there is puberty, which exacts a price for Walt's innocent ability to 'let himself evaporate' so painful that his miraculous abilities, though they do not leave him, can never again be used.!<\n\n>!The narrative seems to go Awol in the second half of the novel, perhaps intentionally to reflect Walt's directionless adult life. But as a parable about learning to love, Mr Vertigo is strongly affecting. Its moments of deep feeling are sometimes jammed up against a piece of smart-ass dialogue or jaunty description; at others, though, they are expressed in a way that is as embarrassingly simple as the descriptions of Walt's aerobatics: love is just another miracle, that's all.!<\n\n\n\n\"Complete the following sentences using proper words from the text\"\n\nMy doubts come from two sentences in particular:\n\n1. He will be \\_\\_\\_\\_\\_ his way back to you in no time, you'll see\n2. The new administration focused on \\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_ corruption to restore public trust.\n\nMy friend thinks the answers are 1. Faltering, and 2. Raking, but I think 1. Crawling and 2.

So, you can have pop-up fireworks stands (fireworks being most popular in America around Independence Day, 4th of July). Or some communities have pop-up vegetable stands during harvest season.

Often, I focus the time we have together on the things that they could hardly improve without assistance, like grammar, pronunciation, etc. I eschew watching videos or reading stuff because I think of those activities as more passive, or things they could easily do on their own. However, I have noticed that many of my advanced students don't truly implement the knowledge they acquire, which makes their skills stagnant.

      "Not an expert by any means, so take this with a grain of salt, but you might be able to kill two birds with one stone by attempting to combine both aspects. Take some of your grammar lessons and throw in some reading or listening. Ask questions relating to what you're teaching, like, \"Was this sentence grammatically correct? How could you rephrase it?\" While I hate to say this as well, it might do some good to assign some weekly listening practice. It doesn't have to be overly much, maybe just an hour of watching some show in English. \n\nWhen I was learning Spanish I remember my teacher would also have us do interpersonal speaking activities, with her occasionally joining in. It helped us refine our pronunciation while also practicing structure; I suspect that this could similarly be applied to English teaching. \n\nAgain, not a professional, and take any ideas you like and tweak them to your needs. Good luck!!",

If your advanced students are not applying the knowledge it is because they are not doing anything with it themselves outside of class, which they need to be doing.\n\nYou can do reading together.

      "Other than the verb ‚Äúbe‚Äù (which is highly irregular) and most modal verbs (which are defective, like ‚Äúcan,‚Äù ‚Äúcould,‚Äù ‚Äúshould,‚Äù ‚Äúmay,‚Äù etc.), all English verbs have:\n- a basic form ([to] see)\n- a present, third-person, singular form (sees)\n- an -ing form (seeing), which is sometimes a present participle and other times a gerund\n- a past form (saw)\n- a past participle (seen)\n\nFor most verbs, the past and past participle are the same (talked; held; cut), but, as with ‚Äúsee‚Äù (above), it‚Äôs possible for them to be different. \n\nThe perfect form of verbs is constructed from a **form of ‚Äúhave‚Äù** (have; has; having; had) and **the past participle of the main verb**. This is why it is possible to have two ‚Äúhaves‚Äù together; one is an auxiliary verb, and the other is the main verb. Note that the auxiliary itself can never be in the perfect (i.e. you cannot have three ‚Äúhaves‚Äù in a row in Standard English).\n\n> I have had a heart attack.\n\n> He has had a heart attack.\n\n> Having had a heart attack, he panicked. \n\n> He had had a heart attack.",
      "\"Had\" can be weird. In place of things like \"must <do something>\" or \"need to <do something>\" you can say \"had to <do something>\" (choosing the appropriate inflections if you need to).\n\nIt would be perfectly fine to say \"I read that article three times today. She heard me talk about it all day\" (although it would more likely be \"She listened ...\".  To emphasis that the aspect of being forced to do something, you can introduce \"had\". So, \"I had to read that article three times. She had to hear \\[listen to\\] me talk about it all day.\" If this was recounting a day that happened awhile ago, that's how you'd say it. \"Remember that time in school blah blah blah... I had to read that article thee times. She...\".\n\nBut, if you were talking about today, when the reading and listening is still going on or just recently finished, you would indicate that by using perfect present. So, imagine walking into a study room where these two people are, and they seem frazzled. You ask them \"why are you so frazzled?\" One of them answers, \"I've had to read this article three times, and she's had to listen to me talk about it.\"",
      "I think of \"have had\" as talking about past things you have done but are still in that state now. \"I have had to read this multiple times\" is something you would maybe say to a friend or study partner while working on homework. They say, \"This text is difficult,\" and you say, \"I know, right! I have had to read it multiple times.\" You are saying the reason you had to read it multiple times still applies in the present. Where if you said, \"I had to read it multiple times,\" you are stating a fact, and that is it. You are saying I did this. It could have been ten years ago or one second ago. \"Have had\" strongly implies you just had to read it again multiple times. It would be weird to say \"I have had to read it multiple times ten years ago\" because there is a strong sense of the same things continuing from the immediate past to the present, not something you only did in the deep past.\n\nAs a native English speaker, it is a weird tense when you think about it. It adds a more \"personal\" feeling to the phrase over the cold, hard, and blunt feeling just using past tense gives.",
      "> why we're using \"have had\" instead of like \"have have\" or \"1 have/has\" if its past tense why its not \"had have\"\n\n\"Have had\" and \"has had\" are present tense because *have/has* is present tense. *Had* is the past participle of *have*, so the whole thing is a present auxiliary + past participle. If the sentence were in past tense, it would be \"had had\": a past auxiliary + past participle. Tense will always be on the first verb/auxiliary.\n\n> I have had to read that article three times.  \n> I've had to read that article three times.

      "**have + to infinitive** is a construction that means something like **must**, it's a semi modal expressing necessity. So if it helps, as you read the present perfect form, you can imagine the verb **need** in its place.

      "English compound verbs are differentiated in both tense and aspect (and mood, but that's another topic).\n\nIt can get really complicated, but in these examples the marker for tense is on the first verb, and the marker for aspect is on the second.

Present perfect denotes an action that started in the past but may or may not have concluded or to denote actions that started in the past and have been repeated a certain number of times up to the present.\n\nIn present perfect, the first verb contains tense and is conjugated appropriately according to person and number. The second verb contains the aspect and the perfective aspect is always the past participle, which does not change according to person and number.\n\nHere's a blog entry I googled.

So you use the past participle \"I have had to read\".\n\nHopefully that makes sense and hopefully someone can explain past participle better than I can.",

And that moment and my own English really have changed me like the way I see myself and I feel special because of it I really feel special and unique.\nGuys am I delusional because of these thoughts like feeling unique and everything? and my bad if there's any grammatical mistakes here",

Share with other people how fulfilling and rewarding it can be to learn another language!\n\n\nPro-tip: your English is great, but try to use more punctuation and separate your text into paragraphs. It will make your writing much easier to read :)",
      "Healthy self respect is fine. Feeling unique in the sense of having a distinct individual personality is fine. Feeling unique as in superior to the rest of the human population is delusional. But you're only 16, so I'll make allowances. It sounds like you enjoy helping people, which is great! But don't expect a meaningful opinion about yourself from people on the internet who haven't met you.\n\nAs for your English journey, I'd say you need to improve your punctuation if you want to write fluent English. You sometimes omit lots of helper words and some of your word choices are not idiomatic, so your English \"sounds\" a bit broken. But that's to be expected if you learned English away from native speakers. Your English is not above average for a 16 year old native speaker.

If you wanna improve your vocabulary, i really recommend that you watch videos about everything, like if you want to learn about kitchen vocabulary, then watch videos about kitchen stuff, its silly, i know, but it helps a lot.

There's a big wasp nest in the barn..... time to go find out myself.\"",
      "This can be done with almost any verb + a reflexive pronoun, to emphasize that the subject is doing the verb. It's different from a true reflexive, when the subject is also the object. But on the surface it looks similar.\n\nA true reflexive verb is simple, and the pronoun \"myself\" or anything else is indicating that the same person is the subject and object of the verb.\n\n\"I burned myself while cooking.\"\n\n\"He drove himself to the airport.\"\n\nNote that prepositions in this case would come after the object, not before:\n\n\"You picked yourself up off the ground.\"\n\n\"She checked herself into the hotel.\"\n\nWhat OP is asking about is **a different use of reflexive pronouns that occurs in English to emphasize that someone is doing something first-hand.** The pronoun isn't acting as a grammatical subject to the verb, but is almost like an intensifier. The important thing is that **it is somehow important that the subject of the sentence is personally doing the action**, rather than some intermediary.\n\nYou also see people often say \"for yourself,\" etc. (\"If you don't believe what I'm telling you, then go see for yourself.\") The grammar is clearer in that usage, so this might be a shortened version of that.\n\n\"If you want something done right, you've got to do it yourself.\" (Common idiom)\n\n\"It was no robbery. They broke it themselves.\"\n\n\"Did he have help, or did he write this himself?\"\n\n\"I have been in a similar situation myself.\"",
      "Be careful with this one. \"It's time to find myself\" means it's time to do some introspection, self-discovery, make an important decision about my life, stuff like that.\n\n\"It's time to find out myself\" means \"It's time to discover \\[something\\] on my own\". \"Find out\" means \"figure out\" or \"seek the truth about \\[something\\]\" or \"research\" or any similar idea.\n\nIn \"find myself\", the \"myself\" is the object of the verb \"find\", just like it would be to \"find the keys I lost\" or \"find the leak\".\n\nIn \"find out myself\" the verb is \"find out\" (i.e. discover) and the \"myself\" is really \"by myself\", meaning I'll do it alone, so it's an adjective describing how I'll go about the finding.\n\nAlso, \"find myself\" is a very common phrase, and it's sort of a rote way to communicate that idea. \"Find out myself\" is not at all rote. So, you really need to rely on context, because maybe the \"out\" was just a mistake.",

      "We don't normally use that term for prawns. We usually describe those as peeled. Sometimes they're described as \"shell on\".\n\nYou are correct to think that the word can be used both ways, and it could be confusing, without context. Soft-shelled crabs, for example, have the shells left on - they're soft enough to be eaten. But a bag of shelled peanuts will have had the shells removed. You can also buy unshelled peanuts. But those will be obvious from the pictures on the packaging.",
      "What, you don't think that makes English fun? :)\n\nI'm not aware of any consistent general pattern for the un-\\[thing\\] rules, so you'll just need to learn each case separately or figure things out from context. Fortunately, the \"shell\" case isn't the worst one. You'll probably never encounter \"unshelled\" at all, and if you do, no one will berate you if you asked for clarification--many of us would be uncertain or at least be given pause. \"Shelled\" as an adjective describing a thing with a shell is also very rare. More common would be \"shell\" with a modifier: soft shell crab, soft shell turtle, hard shell suitcase. So, in the vast majority of \"shelled\" situations you can assume that \"shelled\" means \"the shell has been removed\" and that \"shell\" used as a verb means \"to remove the shell\". And \"shell\" doesn't come up as often as you'd expect. No one talks about shelling an egg (you peel an egg). You shuck oysters. You crack nuts.\n\nBut that \"simplicity\" doesn't extend to other un-\\* situations.",
      "Yeah English does this sometimes",
      "Context is essential to meaning, and whether \"shelled\" means \"something with a shell\" or \"something normally possessing a shell but whose shell has been removed\" depends on the situation. I would consider \"shelled\" to be an example of a [contronym](https://www.dailywritingtips.com/75-contronyms-words-with-contradictory-meanings/), a word with multiple contradictory meanings.\n\nSometimes the meaning is easy to determine. There are no common varieties of cherries which lack pits, so it is rarely ever necessary to refer to cherries as being \"pitted,\" and you can usually assume \"pitted cherries\" refers to cherries whose pits have been removed. In other cases, greater context is needed. \"Russia sanctioned Pakistan\" can either mean that Russia endorsed the actions or position of Pakistan or that Russia imposed restrictions on or otherwise penalized Pakistan.",

      "Purists will tell you not to use it. I was told off numerous times about it by teachers during my schooling, both in the US and the UK.",
      "You can almost always replace \"off of\" with \"off\", but not vice versa",
      "Yes.",
      "It's common in informal American English to add the \"of\". It's never necessary. Bear in mind that people elsewhere might consider it to be incorrect so you might have to adjust your usage depending on your audience, whether you are writing formally, and so on.",
      "Having been taught many years ago that ‚Äúoff of‚Äù is not good grammar, I have avoided its usage. I use ‚Äú from‚Äù instead. However, ‚Äúoff of ‚Äú is the same as ‚Äúoff‚Äù.",
      "In my region (southeast U.S.), ‚Äúoff‚Äù and ‚Äúoff of‚Äù are used pretty interchangeably as prepositions, although if you take a writing class, they‚Äôll tell you to avoid double prepositions and just say ‚Äúoff.‚Äù\n\nI do want to note that ‚Äúoff to the next room‚Äù is a little bit different. When you say ‚ÄúI‚Äôm off to the next room,‚Äù you really mean ‚ÄúI‚Äôm going to the next room‚Äù or ‚ÄúI‚Äôm ‚Äòheaded off‚Äô to the next room,‚Äù so it‚Äôs acting as part of the verb phrase there, not a preposition.\n\nYou wouldn‚Äôt say ‚ÄúI‚Äôm off of the next room‚Äù. It would always be ‚ÄúI‚Äôm off to the next room‚Äù in that context.",
      "From what I understand, \"off of\" is often used in casual speech (especially in American English) to mean \"from\" or \"away from,\" like in your DoorDash example. But sometimes just \"off\" works fine, like with the street market chair.\n\nFor me, the core idea is usually about separation or movement away:\n\n* \"Made money¬†**off of**¬†DoorDash\" ‚Üí money came¬†*from*¬†it.\n* \"Bought the chair¬†**off**¬†the street\" ‚Üí took it¬†*away from*¬†there.\n* \"**Off**¬†to the next room\" ‚Üí moving¬†*away*¬†from here.\n\nSometimes they‚Äôre interchangeable, but not always. Like you wouldn‚Äôt say \"cut the inch¬†**off**¬†the bottom\" sounds fine, but adding \"of\" feels more natural in some dialects.",
      "You never need to say \"off of\". You can just use \"off\" or \"from\" in literally every context I've heard people (always Americans) say \"off of\". I never hear anyone say \"off of\" here.",
      "Hmm. Some of your examples actually don't work for me. \"I made money off of doordash\"--that doesn't scan for me. To make money off of something usually means there's some scheme or some special situation. Making money off of doordash might work if you invested in doordash stock, but not if were were a doordash employee. \n\nAs for buying the chair, I'd say \"My friend bought the chair at the street market\" or \"My friend bought the chair from a merchant in the street market\". \"Bought off\" just doesn't work for me. \n\n\"Off to the next room\" sounds fine to me.\n\n\"I will cut an inch off of the bottom\" or \"I will cut an inch off the bottom\" both work (I did change \"the inch\" to \"an inch\". \"The\" suggests that there's a particular inch at the bottom, but the length you cut off isn't really restricted to just an inch.\n\nI can't think of a general explanation, those are just my reactions to the examples you provided.",
      "It‚Äôs not really exactly the same because there are times when you can‚Äôt use ‚Äúoff of‚Äù but can use ‚Äúoff‚Äù. For example, ‚ÄúI‚Äôm off to the store!‚Äù You can‚Äôt say ‚ÄúI‚Äôm off of to the store!‚Äù So it‚Äôs only interchangeable in some contexts."

It's only in the special case where we're distinguishing \"one\" with an adjective that we can use possessive determiners, like \"my favorite one\".\n\nI could see that being a little confusing. I'm sure some other languages use phrases similar to \"mine favorite\" to convey the same idea \"my favorite one\" does.

    "comments": [
      "Yes, they are both grammatically correct and yes, there is a difference in meaning. \n\n\"I wish he helped me\" = \"I wish he was helpful\". It's a wish for a pattern of behavior.\n\n\"I wish he would help me\" = \"I wish he started helping me \\[with this task I'm currently working on\\]\". It's a wish for a specific behavior right now.\n\nExplanations:\n\n\"I wish\" is present tense, so the person is telling us about their current state of mind. \"He helped me\" is past tense, but it doesn't identify any specific incident, so it means \"he was helpful\". The wish is that his behavior toward the speaker had been more helpful, but even though it alludes to the past, the real wish is that it starts now and continues. The speaker's memories are filled with times when he was unhelpful, and the speaker imagines how much better they would feel if all those times had been filled with helpfulness. And the implication is that if that pattern of helpfulness had existed in the past, then it would likely continue into the future, which is what the speaker really wants. So, \"I wish he helped me\" means \"I wish he was helpful\".\n\n\"He would help me\" is a conjecture about the future, but remember the \"I wish\" means we're talking about the present. So, in the present, he is not helping. The wish is that the current state of not helping stops, and it would only stop if he started helping. So, \"I wish he would help me\" means \"I wish he started helping me\". But \"started helping me\" suggests that an activity is happening right now that the speaker needs help with.",
      "First is a repeated wish, I wish he helped me cook every night. \n\nSecond is future or repeated, but it's emphasizing that he doesn't help because he chooses not to. \n\nFor past it would be I wish he had helped me.",
      " Both sentences are correct, but they have slightly different meanings.\n\n\"I wish he helped me\" implies you want him to help you right now (or generally), but he isn‚Äôt doing it.\n\n\"I wish he would help me\" suggests you want him to decide to help you in the future like you‚Äôre hoping he‚Äôll change his mind.\n\nFor example:\n\nIf your friend never helps with homework, you‚Äôd say, \"I wish he helped me.\"\n\nIf you‚Äôre waiting for him to agree to help, \"I wish he would help me\" fits better.",
      "Depends if you're talking about an imagined regular action or an imagined future\n\nRegular -> I wish he helped me\n\nFuture -> I wish he'd help me",
      "I wish he would help me.",
      "Both are grammatically correct.\n‚ÄúI wish he helped me‚Äù literally has an association\n with being in the past, as ‚Äúhelped‚Äù is the past participle of ‚Äúhelp‚Äù.\nBut people still use this to mean present tense sometimes, depending on the context.\nAn example might be someone complaining about their coworker and saying ‚Äú I wish he helped me‚Äù.\nIt‚Äôs understood that the situation will be continuing so ‚Äúhelped‚Äù is mostly fine in this context to be present tense.\n\n‚ÄúI wish he would help me‚Äù would mean this person isn‚Äôt helping you, either purposely or not, right now or in the future.",
      "‚ÄúI wish he would help me sometime‚Äù or simply ‚ÄúI wish he would help me ‚Äú also is used simply to state that they wish the person would help at any time.  Like help around the damn house.  I can hear my wife saying it now."

      "I'd say 99% yes. If I were speaking to her and didn't know anything about her I wouldn't bat an eye, at least not at first. I would have trouble placing where in the States she was from, though. I would probably assume she had moved around. \n\n Because you mentioned she's not a native speaker I was listening extra closely, and there were a couple of things that were just slightly off. Like pronouncing a real 't' in \"noticed\" instead of a tap. But very, very minor issues.",
      "she's saying too many T's\n\nshe also has \"influencer accent.\" this is close to how some American influencers sound, but it's not a real American accent you hear irl. I'd be curious to know if she speaks like this all the time, or just for social media.",
      "It sounds pretty close to General American with a few really minor pronunciation slip-ups, the clearest probably being her saying Eiffel Tower as /…õfl t√¶.ur/ instead of /a…™fl t√¶.ur/. If I had to guess, I would assume she was raised multilingual and learned English early in life and in tandem with other languages.",
      "She sounds perfectly natural.  Only desperate nitpick would be her pronunciation is almost too crisp and perfect, but it comes off as idiosyncratic rather than accent-y.",
      "For like five seconds, sure. But every seven seconds or so there's a highly localized pronunciation, and none of those localizations are from the same place. Maybe due to the content of this video, but a few of the words that pop out sound like ESL from French, some sound like ESL from anywhere (really crisp effortful t's), and one sounds like ESL from an east Asian language.\n\nShe also says singular nouns where a plural noun is more proper. That is a common grammar error from even native speakers who also speak an east Asian language (eg 2nd gen).",
      "Very very close, but if I had a 2-minute conversation with someone who sounds like this, I'd suspect they weren't from the US.",
      "I think like 95%?  Some singular nouns do not sound native, some vowel sounds are slightly off, and pronouncing every t in ‚Äúimmediately noticed‚Äù was very jarring.  I don‚Äôt think I would assume this is a native speaker, but maybe someone who has lived most of their adult life in the USA.",
      "It‚Äôs passable for sure. I find a few of the words which have clashing consonant sounds ‚Äúfamiliar‚Äù ‚ÄúSargent‚Äù ‚Äútraditional‚Äù have a bit of what I‚Äôd call ‚Äúover-annunciation‚Äù but most of her pronunciation is really natural and flowing the way I‚Äôd expect from an American speaking English. I think even 20 years ago the accent common among people her age was far less casual and relaxed and a few of those ticks wouldn‚Äôt have stood out nearly as much.",
      "For the most part, yes, sounds very native. There are definitely some things she says where you can tell it‚Äôs not her original accent. If I was having a conversation with her I would have asked where she was from originally.\n\nI‚Äôm very much interested in accents and it‚Äôs something I actively listen to when meeting new people. I find them fascinating. I can blame Hollywood for that, the amount of times I would look up an actor/actress I liked, only to discover they weren‚Äôt actually Americans like they portrayed their character. It‚Äôs become a bit of a game for me  when watching movies or TV shows to listen for accent slips.",
      "Doesn't sound like a native speaker. But what's wrong with that?  She is still perfectly intelligible and would have no problem navigating English speaking life. The T's give it away. We USA people drop those always. Also, her \"Eiffel Tower\".....while right in French, no one in USA would say it that way.",
      "The American accent was beautiful and sounded native for the most part. There were only a few parts that maybe slipped into what maybe sounded like British English, like when she said \"immediately noticed\" and the word \"spirited.\" Overall I would be able to tell it isn't just an American accent because of the slips into the other accent, which do not happen very much. But what she does say in the American accent is excellently done.",
      "Yes, it sounds perfectly native. Her mother tongue might be Cantonese, but it sounds like she also learned both English and French from a young age.",
      "Yeah she‚Äôs basically native but I can tell she‚Äôs not native native if you know what I mean",
      "I pick up the slightest French accent on some words. Otherwise sounds pretty close to native."

I recently saw a native speaker who struggled to use possessive pronouns, and would refer to people‚Äôs body parts as ‚Äúthe X‚Äù as opposed to ‚Äúhis X.‚Äù They may have been bilingual though, which would explain that. In general, people struggle with ‚Äúthan‚Äù vs ‚Äúthen‚Äù as well.\n\nFor me, grammar rules that come easily while writing don‚Äôt always come out in my speech.

I‚Äôm sure that rules exist for a number of things but for native speakers something just ‚Äúsounds right‚Äù or ‚Äúsounds wrong‚Äù\n\nSecondly, there is also the fact that languages evolve. Words come in and out of use.

The joke is that she thinks he is saying he pooped so hard, maybe due to constipation or other reasons, that he ended up hurting himself.

Great vocab, seriously.\n\nRely, not relay\n\nOptimize, not optimise\n\n\"Help me draft\" not \"help me to draft\" Very very very technically we can say that \"Help me to...\" has evolved over time to being correct and I can think of plenty of times my country friends have said it like that, but for someone who is learning correct English I'd say to stick with the grammatically correct \"It can help me (verb)\"\n\n*There were cats, dogs, cows, and even mice.*\n\nMake sure you put the comma after that last spot even though nothing technically comes after it. Here's what it should look like:\n\n\"I use it heavily, from emails, presentations, to even short messages with friends.\"\n\n\"Keeping improving\" isn't correct, you should say something like \"Continuing to improve\" or you can throw in something like \"Keeping consistency\" \n\n\"I always had some excuses\" is fine but \"I always had some excuse\" is better subject verb agreement \n\n\n\"As an English learner, not a student but\" Make sure the comma is after that segment that is before but. It should be \"As a learner, not a student, but someone who believes...\"\n\n\"So it is the time to go back the right track\" I think you should say \"get back on track\"\n\n\"So it is time to get back on track\"\n\nYou could make the original sound prettier but no additional touchup will flow as nicely as the very common expression \"get back on track\"\n\n\n\"When you are advanced than them\" Should be \"When you are more advanced than them\"\n\n\nFun subject. The truth is, AI is very very good at explaining language. And you can absolutely trust it to teach you English, it's extremely efficient, the thing is you just need to know how to direct it and what you want to learn. Its like a big fridge, but there's nothing in it until you speak that certain food into it. It's very surprising how fast it's developing, and unfortunately it's on track to kill most translation agencies. It's a shame, but it's undoubtedly a great tool.\n\nBut yeah, your English level is pretty good, and you probably don't need a tool to help you actually form sentences. It's the little stuff you're tripping up on, and that's perfectly okay because the nuances are difficult.",
      "Thank you so much for helping me correct the mistakes. They are really helpful, from explanation, examples, to the technical background of the language. I will continue to write in this way, I believe keeping consistency is the key to be proficiency, and more advanced, no more excuse.\n\nFor AI, not only LLM usage like ChatGPT, but all these evolutional AI technologies, they definitely give our lives big shocks everyday. I am not sure if there will be a sad ending or a happy one, but I believe it is time to rethink how to use them in better ways.\n\n(The text above is also based on what I learned from your comment)\n\nHere is the revised version of my post:\n\nI do not use ChatGPT or any other tools to help me draft any writings, but I do rely on it to optimise my writings, to polish them, or at least it can help me to catch some uncommon used expressions. I use it heavily, from emails, presentations, to even short messages with friends.\n\nAs an English learner, not a student, but someone who believes continuing to improve is essential, I knew relying on AI would hurt the progress, but I always had some excuse. For example I told myself, I would study the revised version and learn form it, or AI would give me some insights I did not know. But I rarely did it as I promised, my brain just got lazier and lazier, and less confident on any of my expression, from writing to speaking.\n\nSo it is the time to go back on track, to express in the organic way and learn from the mistakes. I did not say we should not use AI, but only when you are more advanced than them, use them to work with you, not for you."

They are not natural English, but are adapted to match the music and rhythm they accompany. They often contain very specific colloquialisms, and in the end they do not have to be grammatical or to make any sense at all.

      "Happy to help! Gonna junp right in. I'm on my phone, so please ignore spelling mistakes. Others, correct me if I'm wrong on any of my points.\n\nUbiquitous: So, most native English speakers would use 'has become' or 'became' over 'has gone'. Usually, 'has gone' would be used for when an action taken in the past is still relevant in the present. Ubiquitous is an adjective, not an action, so 'has become' would fit more naturally. Thereby was used correctly, but I rarely see it outside of academic papers. In the sentence you used, it can be dropped without changing the meaning of the sentence. Like so:\nInformation Technology has become ubiquitous throughout the last 3 decades, revolutionizing the way we live.\n\nSanctions: In English, the word sanction is both a noun and a verb. When used as a noun, it generally means a penalty for disobeying laws or rules. Most often, we see it when discussing politics. Sanction as a verb can mean to either impose a penalty, e.g. 'Employers who break minimum wage laws should have financial sanctions placed on them', or to give approval of an action, e.g. 'The bishop sanctioned their divorce on the grounds of adultery.' \nIn your sentence given, a better word would be consequences, as your actions could have positive or negative effects.\nThe phrase 'As a result' would begin a new sentence, so you will want to either use a semicolon or period and separate the two parts, or change it to 'resulting in'. Your sentence can be changed into either of the following:\nYou should always anticipate the consequences of your actions; as a result you will live a better life.\nYou should always anticipate the consequences of your actions , resulting in a better life.\nBoth sentences above mean the same thing, juat a difference in phrasing.\n\nEspionage: Espionage is being used incorrectly here. Espionage is not a person, but an act someone or something does. For your sentence, the word spy or secret agent would make more sense. Also, the last bit is incorrect as well. 'A good idea' and 'however, a bad execution,' are phrases and incomplete sentences about the play. There are several ways to correct this.\nA) 'The play was about a spy who travels between countries . It was a good idea; however, it was badly executed.' In this one, we make the second part a complete sentence on its own and change 'bad execution' to 'badly executed' to describe how the play was performed.\nB) 'The play, which was about a spy who travels between countries, was a good idea with bad execution.' In this change, we connect the ideas of the play into one sentence. \nI do want to point out that in spoken English, you cna get away with incomplete sentences when describing something. So if you were speaking you could say 'good idea, bad execution.' After describing the play's plot. Do not do this in written english.\n\nHearsay:  I'm going to admit, I'm really confused at your sentence. Prominent means noticeable, important, or widely recognized; it's an adjective used to describe a noun. But, the word 'say' is verb, meaning to speak. There is the word 'saying', usually referring to phrases of speech most of us would recognize. So, are you meaning important people are speaking, or that there is an important rumor being spread? That would need to be cleared up. We would also use 'in' over 'during', as the phrase puts the accident in the past.  As to the second part, Hearsay would not have an S at the end. The first sentence seems to convey a single thought: 'they were killed in the accident'. Since it is one rumor or thought we're discussing, hearsay would remain singular. While I know hearsay as a plural form, I've never heard it used in its plural form. \n\nCalamity: This sentence is correct, as far as I can tell. I think hence needs another comma after it, but I could be wrong. You can substitute calamity with disaster, tragedy, or catastrophe if you want; it would depend on how severe the event was. Likewise, caution could substitute carefulness and have the same meaning.\n\nOverall, you did well.",

      "Thank you for devoting your time , appreciated üôè.",
      "Do you mean, a widely believed rumor? I'm asking because 'prominent say' is not a phrase or idiom used in English. We would say 'it's said...' or 'the rumor is...' or 'it's widely believed...'",
      "It's more like \"widely believed\" but I guessed \"prominent say\" would also work.",
      "Got it. So, just use 'it's widely believed'. Again, 'Prominent say' isn't a phrase in English, or at least, so rarely used most will not understand if you use it. Prominent tends to be used more when describing a feature of something, like 'their Prominent nose', 'the Prominent figures of society', or 'the Prominent feature of the landscape is the mountains.' When repeating information that's been spread, especially by word of mouth, we use rumor or gossip. If the information has been written, then we would say 'reports' or 'news'. So that sentence would be clearer if you put it like this:\n\nIt's believed they were killed in the accident. However, that's all hearsay.",
      "Sweaty Disaster is sending you in the right direction; you need a new word for \"say\". \"Say\" isn't the noun you would use here. Rumor, gossip, theory, idea, thoughts, even \"talk\" can be a noun. Chatter. Whispers.\n\nTo my surprise, the dictionary includes \"hearsays\" as a plural, but I've never heard this used.\n\nJust for fun, here are some other synonyms from the dictionary:\n\nSynonyms\nbuzz, dish, gossip, noise, report, rumor, scuttlebutt, talk, tattle, word",
      "Understood , thank you.",
      "Try this:\n\nThe predominant theory is that they were killed in the accident, however, no one knows the details so this is all just hearsay.\n\n\n\"Hearsay\" is literally what you heard someone say. It doesn't make it true. \"I heard Farmer Brown say they were killed in an accident!\" Did Farmer Brown witness an accident? Then we should talk to the farmer. If the farmer isn't the witness, then it's still hearsay, because the farmer heard someone else say it."

      "Quick clarification: u/IntrepidEffective977, you are entirely correct in this case, but I found myself using the word \"vocabularies\" in my comment. \"English vocabulary\" will almost always be singular, but the two cases I can think of are:\n\n* Vocabularies of different languages (e.g., The Spanish, French, and Italian vocabularies are all largely based on Latin words.)\n* Vocabularies of different people (e.g., The children's vocabularies grew larger as the children got older.)\n\nIn your case, u/Extension-Divide-662, however, u/IntrepidEffective977 is correct that it's a collective noun.\n\nGood luck with learning the English language, the rules can be tough!",

For example:\n\n* It is time to study for my Vocabulary lesson.\n* My Vocabulary homework was very easy.\n\nThis fits with more general use, like:\n\n* Reading has greatly expanded my vocabulary.\n* My favorite author has a large vocabulary.\n\n\"Vocabulary\" class versus \"Vocabularies\" class could be a regional thing, though. I know that in America, \"Mathematics\" is shortened to \"Math\" (e.g., Geometry is a Math class) where in Britain \"Mathematics\" is shortened to \"Maths\" (e.g., Trigonometry is a Maths class)."

    "text": "Hi guys I stumbled upon this tweet related to deltarune and wanted to know if this dialogue in the second image is a conditional, question or future in the past, when Noelle says \"y'know you'd help me...\" watch the tweet for context\nKeep in mind that these first two images are from chapter 4 en the other 2 are from chapter 2.\n\n\n",

      "Like it's similar to this \"When we were kids we would play all day\"?¬†",
      "\"Y'know, you'd help me... faha, break into my own room\"\n\nI feel like I'm missing context, and I don't know what \"faha\" is, but here's my analysis. Let's start with a different sentence and work our way up.\n\n\"When I'm sick, you take care of me\". It's present tense and conditional.\n\n\"When I get sick, you will take care of me\". It's future conditional.\n\n\"When I get sick, will you take care of me?\" it's future conditional but as a question.\n\n\"When\" and \"if\" are sometimes interchangeable. So,  let's try:\n\n\"If I get sick, will you take care of me?\" That works, but we can enhance the hypothetical feel with \"would\":\n\n\"If I get sick, would you take care of me?\" The previous one was more of just a straight question, but this one has an element of pleading to it. I'm not just wondering if you will take care of me, I'm implicitly asking you to take care of me, or I'm admitting that I hope you do indeed take care of me. I don't know what tense or mood that is, but that's the gist of what's going on. You could emphasize the hypothetical further:\n\n\"If I were to get sick, would you take care of me?\"\n\nOkay, so let's apply this to the original tweet. If it were a question, we'd have something like:\n\n\"If I asked you to, would you help me break into my own room?\"\n\nBut this character is confident that their friend would indeed help them, so rather that ask, they are making a statement:\n\n\"If I asked you to, you would help me break into my own room.\" \n\nBut the specific condition doesn't matter, because they can rely on their friendship, and so we can express just the raw conclusion to the implicit hypothetical question:\n\n\"You'd help me break into my own room\". (\"you'd\" = \"you would\")\n\nI'm going to ignore the \"Y'know, \" part for now.",
      "I just read what you answered, but then the description of the tweet wouldn't make so much sense if that were the case, Why in the description is mentioning then that they grew apart. And also the 3 and 4 image are images from Chapter 2, like for context I guess",
      "The context is that the deer girl was once close enough to the other character to ask them for help breaking into her own house. The second picture shows that this is no longer the case, she now prefers to turn to someone else instead.",
      "I don't really understand the pictures and dialog in the tweet. I was doing my best to come up with an explanation of that specific sentence. I think I'm just missing too much context to give you a better answer. Maybe I shouldn't have tried to answer at all. Sorry.",

Unfortunately for prepositions, you just have to memorize which of them sound right in each phrase. Native speakers don‚Äôt have to formally learn it because we just hear each common prepositional phrase frequently.\n\nI would say probably the easiest way to think about it is to treat a simple prepositional phrase as its own vocabulary word. So rather than learning that ‚Äúon‚Äù goes with the word ‚Äúfire‚Äù, memorize the phrase ‚Äúon fire‚Äù and translate that into your native language. For translational purposes think of that as its own vocabulary word, rather than two words.",

Sorry, it's just a mess and you'll just need to find some peace about that.\n\nI think it's probably just historical accident that we use \"at risk\" instead of \"in risk\", for example. Maybe there is some rational explanation, but I don't say \"at risk\" because of that explanation, I say \"at risk\" cause it just sounds right.",

      ">Getting lots of listening practice through watching shows or movies is one of the best ways to learn what sounds natural in my opinion.\n\nI'm strongly seconding this - there really aren't always logical or consistent rules to which preposition is used in which context. A branch might be \"on fire\" but a bucket \"iced over.\" Native or fluent English speakers just get used to which prepositions go with which nouns in which context. It's a form of memorization, but in my opinion listening practice is a much better solution than, say, flashcards. \n\nI'm putting this bit under a spoiler tag because it's complicated and not necessarily related to the rest of the comment: >!There's also more fun with common but illogical formulations: \"The new law quickly came under fire\", is a sentence using the phrase \"came under fire\" to mean \"received a lot of criticism\". \"Being under fire\" more literally means \"is being shot at\", and has nothing to do with flames being above you.!< English is tricky and prepositional phrases can be tough!\n\nJust as a little funny example of how prepositions are difficult even for native English speakers, here's a clip from a British show with native British speakers that involves one contestant interpreting a prepositional phrase differently than everybody else:\n\n[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gznDGyNiDlg](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gznDGyNiDlg)\n\nGood luck - prepositions are probably the trickiest part of English.",

For example:¬†\n\n>Of Stew and Rabbits\nOf the Return of the Noldor\nOf Beleriand and its Realms\nOf the Noldor in Beleriand\n\nEach of those chapters is about what is in the title.\n\nIt also appears in poetic language, like the first lines of the Odyssey:\n\n>Sing to me of the man, Muse, the man of twists and turns\n\nOr the first lines of the Aeneid:\n\n>I sing of arms and the man, he who, exiled by fate, //¬†first came from the coast of Troy to Italy\n\nIt's not a common construction in modern English, but survives in the colloquial 'Speaking of ____'.\n\nSo in naming his novel 'Of Mice and Men', Steinbeck is playing with the language since the title can be read both ways.",

It's based on a Robert Burns poem \"To a Mouse\". The line is actually \"The best laid schemes of mice and men gang aft agley\" (that last bit is Scottish, look up the poem for more info). In this, the idea of mice and men is meant to show a range from the very small and the very big. \n\nAlthough the title has a direct source, the use of \"of\" in this context would generally be omitting something like \"\\[On the subject\\] of...\" It's been a long time since I read the novel, and don't remember all of it, but I feel like the title might be leaning towards this usage, though it's meant to also evoke the poem as well.",

      "\"Mice and Men\" is just two nouns. \"Of Mice and Men\" implies a similarity, a comparison between mice and men. It's a truncated version of a longer quote, but on its own it invites you to consider what mice and men have in common (that their best-laid plans go awry)",

It's not completely wrong, but it would strike me as strange. \n\nI think \"to warn of\" sounds better with an object that's abstract. \"They warned me of the high rate of crime in the station\" sounds more appropriate.

      "Grammar isn't really were we have problems. Spelling is usually what gets us (to/two/too, or there/they're/their, or it's versus its), because we learned the language as sounds.\n\nIssues with grammar for native English speakers are typically things like:\n\n* The biggest uncertainty of course is whether to use \"...and I\" or \"...and me\". In school they beat into us it's almost always supposed to be \"and I\" like \"Bob and I (went to the store...)\" but there are legit cases where it's \"and me\" like \"Give the ball to Jim and me\".\n* *If XYZ were...* = correct. It's 50/50 on whether people say \"If XYZ was...\". This is the subjunctive mood and so should be 'were'\n* Should've... School doesn't teach us the should/would/could've contraction. People sometimes write this as \"should of\" as in \"I should of done that\". because \" of\" and \"-'ve\" are spoken identically. It's \"should've\" from \"should have\".\n* Verb plurality mismatch because the subject is singular but there's a description with plural in between the single subject and the verb. An example I can think of at the moment are things like: \"The garden with hundreds of flowers are open\" or \"The museum full of paintings cost $10 to get into.\" People hear the plural words and then speak the verb for plural, when really \"the garden\" and \"the museum\" are the subjects.\n* How to handle talking about an unknown single individual, can lead to clunky wording. When I was in school the 'correct' thing to do was to say \"his or her\" like \"Each passenger should pick up his or her luggage at the baggage carousel\". Traditionally teachers hated it when we use \"they\" in that place but it sounds fine.\n* Rules that have gone away\n   * Whom, people use \"who\" for both \"who\" and \"whom\" situations\n   * \"It is I\" is correct, but people will say \"It is me\" or \"It's him\". Neither of these sound correct or wrong.\n   * School traditionally stressed not ending sentences with prepositions, but the people who made traditional grammar loved Latin and phrasal verbs are a Germanic thing so there are lots of cases where you end up with sentences that end in \"prepositions\", which are really just the non-verb word of the phrasal verb\n\nOtherwise things like articles and verb tenses and irregular words don't really get us because we just have a sense of what sounds right, like you do in your native language. \n\nLittle children often get tripped up by irregular verbs but that goes away as they get older and hear the language more, like a kid saying \"The car goed away\".\n\nSome of the irregular verbs sometimes make people stop and think about them. Like what is it for \"drink\"? Obviously \"I drank\" but \"I have drunk?\" or \"I have drunken?\" or even \"I have dranken?\" all of these sound ok. There are non-irregular verbs that seem like they should fit the vowel change pattern but they don't, and stuff like that.",
      "What's your native language? Do you struggle with its grammar?",
      "Native speakers have an intuitive understanding of when and how to use articles. That said, it‚Äôs totally understandable that they may be confusing for you if your language uses them differently (like, e.g., Spanish) or lacks them altogether (like, e.g., Mandarin or Russian). \n\nThe same is true for phrasal verbs; they‚Äôre so common in everyday speech, we don‚Äôt normally think about them. Most native speakers could not tell you what a phrasal verb even is. \n\nHowever, there are other grammar ‚Äúmistakes‚Äù that natives make, which are most noticeable in formal speaking and writing. For example:\n- using ‚Äúof‚Äù rather than the contracted form of ‚Äúhave‚Äù (should of vs. should‚Äôve)\n- using ‚Äúthere‚Äôs‚Äù rather than ‚Äúthere‚Äôre‚Äù with plural subjects (There‚Äôs two apples. vs. There‚Äôre two apples.)\n- (especially as children) irregular plurals (two mouses vs. two mice; two sheeps vs. two sheep)\n- using incorrect verb forms (have ran vs. have run; I drunk vs. I drank)\n\nThe extent to which these should be understood as mistakes or simply linguistic variation depends on the context. \n\nIf you can give some examples that confuse you, I‚Äôd be happy to help you with articles (a[n] vs. the).",

      "grammar comes naturally to native speakers for the most part. spelling though?",
      "For the most part, no, unless it's some really obscure grammar rule. Of course everyone messes up sometimes, but that's mostly misspeaking, not misunderstanding the rules. That's what being a native speaker means; it comes naturally. We also learn grammar in school, so it's common to hear children make mistakes, but much less so for adults. I do make a lot of mistakes in other languages though!\n\n'The' is used when referring to one specific object, 'a' is used when referring to a single, unspecified object of a certain type. \n\nFor example:  \n\"I want a banana.\" - The speaker isn't talking about a specific banana, they just want one.  \n\"I want the banana.\" - The user wants one specific banana, and it's clear through context which banana that is, because said banana was already the topic of conversation, or because the speaker otherwise indicated it (such as through a gesture).\n\nUse 'the' when the specific instance of the object you're talking about is important, or if there's only one in existence (E.g. 'The United States of America'. 'A United States of America' doesn't make sense because there's only one United States of America). This goes for almost all proper nouns in most cases, as there's usually no confusion as to which you're talking about.\n\nFor certain things, there is one instance that is so much more well known that you can refer to it as 'the (object)' and it will be obvious which one is being talked about. For example, if you say 'the Moon' it's obvious you're talking about Earth's moon.\n\nThere are a few weird cases, as with anything. The is used when referring to a type of environment ( 'the ocean', 'the beach', 'the woods', 'the desert', 'the city,' etc.) Think of these as the concept of the type of area not instances of them. 'I love the beach' is equivalent to 'I love beaches', but people will nearly always use the former. 'The city' refers to cities in general, not a specific city. A few other things follow this pattern as well, such as types of weather (the rain), temperature (the cold), and light level (the dark).",
      "Be happy that you don't have to learn German. English is a simple language and the faults native speakers struggle with draw a mild smile on my face.",
      "With the exception of teachers or students of the language, the biggest problem native speakers have when discussing English grammar with a non-native speaker is the terminology. As we become familiar with the language even from the moment of our birth and become increasingly competent over many years with constant practice, we rarely encounter terms such \"subjunctive clauses\" and \"present perfect tense\", if at all. Our skills develop over time and the standard we achieve is largely dependent upon the quality of our reading material and those with whom we routinely converse."

      "I believe it is possible to \"finetune\" your English by yourself, but you need to have a good foundation. The thing is, the \"practice makes perfect\" notion is very true, so you need to find ways to practice by yourself. I do English \"coaching\" (I don't have the time to spend on lengthy tutoring sessions) with my clients doing most of the work themselves using techniques like parroting and convert rehearsal. It can be very successful for those who are self-motivated and can find the time, but useless for those who can't.

I know online and group courses can definitely be cheaper if money‚Äôs a concern, but 1-on-1 almost always wins out, *especially* for intermediate and advanced students.\n\nWhatever you do though, ***keep studying on your own time as well***. No single teacher or course is going to make you fluent, and the more you study and **use** English outside of class (watching tv and movies, playing video games, reading books, listening to podcasts, posting on social media, chatting with native speakers, etc. in English), the better off you‚Äôll be.",

Cuz here in school and uni we study them over and over again I'm still feeling that they are complicated and in real life u don't use them all? So which ones u usually use?",
    "comments": [
      "Native speakers use all tenses and their aspects. There are none that we don‚Äôt use at all. Some we don‚Äôt use every day. Many dialects have their own tenses and constructions, but that‚Äôs a different topic entirely. \n\nThe most common are simple present, simple past, simple future, present continuous, and present perfect. These are also where you encounter most of the irregular forms.\n\nAs for when native speakers use tenses in ways not mentioned in your textbook - these are the examples I can think of (I‚Äôm sure there are more):\n\nWe often use the present and present continuous tenses to talk about things planned in the future -> ‚ÄúShe gets here at 9.‚Äù ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre going to Denmark next year.‚Äù I think your textbook might go over this, but I‚Äôm not sure. \n\nSometimes we switch to the simple present tense (the so-called ‚Äúdramatic present‚Äù) to tell a story that happened in the past (the context is pretty much always clear.) ‚ÄúSo yesterday, I go to my friend‚Äôs house and knock on the door and she says‚Ä¶‚Äù\n\nWe also use the construction ‚Äúwas going to X‚Äù to talk about things that were planned or considered but didn‚Äôt happen. ‚ÄúI was going to reply, but I forgot.‚Äù It‚Äôs a ‚Äúfuture in the past‚Äù that didn‚Äôt happen, and it‚Äôs very common.",
      "‚ÄúNext spring I will have been on Reddit for 8 years. Or would have been, had I not been banned.‚Äù\n\nWe use all the forms, just not all the time.",
      "Native speakers use them all, though a lot of them don't realise it. Unless they have studied English, a lot of native speakers just think of past, present and future as being the only tenses. Natives learn languages organically, learners learn them technically. So learners know about the technical aspects of the language, while users don't know about them, even though they use them every day.",
      "Don't try to learn rules.\n\nLearn natural speech instead.\n\nTrying to learn rules isn't helpful - there are so many exceptions to all the rules that you'll just get confused.\n\nWe use lots of different tenses in everyday speech, so it's difficult to give examples. Is there anything more specific that has confused you about it?\n\nPlease remember to use a capital letter for \"I\" - it's important. Also, *please* don't abbreviate \"you\" to \"u\". It just makes you sound stupid.",
      "Could you include examples?",
      "Yes, it's true. There are various colloquial and dialectal variations.\nFor instance, some native speakers say \"If I would have seen\" where the grammar books prescribe \"If I had seen\".\n\nAlso, in everyday conversation, the future perfect progressive and past perfect progressive are both rare, although I'm unaware whether there are any speakers who avoid them entirely or if people just don't see the need for them particularly often.\n\nAnother thing: in British English we've seen a reduction in the usage of the present perfect (this began in the US, where the process is even further advanced) - so many people say \"I already ate\" where traditional British grammar prescribed \"I've already eaten\".",
      "All 12. Routinely, and often. It is not uncommon for a sentence to have very specific tense constructions.",
      "Verbs in English really only have two tenses - present and past.¬†\n\nI run; I ran.¬†\n\nAdditionally the verb has two participle forms - present and past: running; run.\n\nFrom that, a¬†huge number of ‚Äòtenses‚Äô in English are actually formations from ‚Äòto be‚Äô plus a present participle, ‚Äòto have‚Äô plus a past participle, and then from forming present participles from ‚Äògoing‚Äô plus the to-form of the infinitive.¬†\n\nI am running; I was running; I am going to run; I am going to be running; I have run; I am going to have run; I had run; I am going to have been running; I had been running; I had been going to run; I had been going to be running‚Ä¶\n\nAnd then¬†the future tense with ‚Äòwill‚Äô is just a special modal, like ‚Äòwould‚Äô, ‚Äòshould‚Äô, ‚Äòcould‚Äô, ‚Äòcan‚Äô, ‚Äòmust‚Äô, which you can use not just with the verb itself but also with ‚Äòto be‚Äô and ‚Äòto have‚Äô to layer in even more options:\n\nI will run; I will be running; I will have run; I will be going to have run; I will be going to have been running; I could have been going to run; I must have been going to be running‚Ä¶\n\nThese aren‚Äôt, I don‚Äôt think, distinct ‚Äòtenses‚Äô to be learned; it‚Äôs a small but hugely productive set of tools that English speakers just instinctively stitch together to create nuances of positioning actions in time and certainty.¬†\n\nAdd in the formation of passives from ‚Äòto be‚Äô plus past participles, and you get even more tense/voice variations.¬†",
      "The are twelve tenses (though some of them are really ‚Äúmoods‚Äù but whatever) for every verb, but there are not twelve distinct sets of verb *forms* that you might expect to go with them. Even *be* only has eight different forms, which (between them, and sometimes with auxiliaries) satisfy all possible persons and tenses. In some ways this makes English easier (fewer forms! Yay!) but it also makes it more complex (you need to remember that *were* is plural only when used as indicative past tense, but singular when used as thr subjunctive). A native speaker doesn‚Äôt have to think about that stuff. At least not as hard.",
      "I wasn't even cognizant of what some of them were called until I was learning another language.",
      "One thing is that in spoken speech we don‚Äôt tend the simple present tense, without any kind of elaboration/adverb. What I mean is we don‚Äôt say things like ‚ÄúI eat now‚Äù ‚Äú I go now.‚Äù We tend to say ‚ÄúI‚Äôm going now‚Äù or ‚ÄúI‚Äôm about to go‚Äù",
      "There‚Äôs 12?!",
      "Not only do we use all of them, but also most of us do so intuitively. But even those of us who have learned some foreign languages would struggle to name them all. \n\nGrammar has not been taught well or consistently a Ross the anglosphere.",
      "As a  new language learner, the 12 tenses are really confusing me",
      "Can you clarify what you mean by \"tense\"? Tense is how verbs reflect time, and there are only 3 tenses in English: past, present, future.¬†\n\n\nPast: I kicked the ball.\nPresent: I kick the ball.\nFuture: I will kick the ball.\n\n\nThis is a big simplification, but hopefully it will help clarify what we mean and what you are asking for."

I missed or forgot to use Duolingo only 16 times in 4 years and 6 months. I‚Äôve spent 1677 days in Duolingo, and during that time, I completed the \"English course\" for Russian speakers.

If you don‚Äôt know what a unit or section is, I‚Äôll try to explain. My course is called \"Intermediate English.\" This course includes 4 sections, and each section includes several units. Each unit also includes lessons, maybe 30‚Äì40. Right now, I‚Äôm in Section 1, which has 51 units, and I try to complete one unit each day without finishing every lesson, and then move on to the next section.\n\nWhat can I say about the Duolingo app? I don‚Äôt know. Honestly, I think that little cute owl gave me more than I expected. My school knowledge was very, very small. I couldn‚Äôt even connect a few words to make a simple sentence. But now, after Duolingo, I feel more confident. I can make sentences, I can speak, yeah, I still make some mistakes, but I can express my thoughts and explain what I want, and understand my opponent. So I think that cute little owl is useful. But if you want to go further, you also need to practice listening, reading, speaking, and writing.\n\nWhat‚Äôs next?

It's not wrong as such, but it's just \"small\" is not used in that way by native speakers and it's very common for non-natives to use it for oblivious reasons.\n\n\"I only learned a small amount at school, I couldn't even....\" makes sense.\n\n\"My school knowledge was very little\" is a little better than small but barely, but you could say \"I learned very little at school, I couldn't even ...\" instead.\n\n\"My school knowledge is/was very very poor\" or \"very very limited\" is a natural alternative - meaning the knowledge is lacking rather than it has a small size.\n\nOr, \"We didn't learn very much at school, I couldn't even ...\"\n\nGood luck with your journey!",
      "Is it understandable? Yes, it's very understandable.\n\nWhat do I think, what's my opinion? It doesn't have the fluency of an adult native speaker. I'd expect the writer to be young or to not be a native English speaker.

It would be better to make them all the same, like\n\n*  describe my experience with the Duolingo app\n* summarize ow many times I use Duolingo\n* explain what I get from it \n* share my opinion\n\nThen, I agree with the other poster that \"opponent\" is the wrong word unless you're talking about something like a formal debate.\n\nThird, you write\n\n>  each section includes several units...Right now, I‚Äôm in Section 1, which has 51 units, \n\n51 is say too high a number for \"several.\" I would give a range like you do for lessons or just say something like \"multiple\" or \"some number of\" or something vague like that. \"Several\" really does imply less than 10 at most.",

You can change this by losing \"of different sizes\", which I don't think is neccessary. Perhaps in context it is important that you are talking about a big thing and a small thing looking the same size, but you can also make two medium things look big and small.",
      "The last word should be \"size\", not sizes, because you're talking about the property.\n\nThey don't really *create* an illusion. They *give the* illusion. And it's not *about* their actual size, just *of* it.\n\nAn illusion of their relative size is rather awkward, because we haven't said what their size actually is. It would make sense if we knew they were actually the same size, for example.\n\nI think \"false impression\" works better, anyway.\n\nAnd... I'm going to use \"Placing\" as a verb, because then it makes more sense - the action of placing them is what gives the impression (or creates the illusion).\n\nAnd as always, keep things simple. Often, it's clearer if you use fewer words.\n\n> Placing objects at a different distances from an observer can give a false impression of their size.\n\n(Or \"relative size\", if you like.)",

Little distinctions like this trip me up sometimes!",
      "Shouldn't it be \"actual size\" instead of \"relative size?\" Relative size is how large or small an object appears when compared to something else, whereas actual size refers to its real dimensions. For example, the sun and moon have nearly identical relative sizes, which is why the moon completely obscures the sun during a solar eclipse. But their actual sizes are extremely different.  \n\nIf you place a soccer ball 10 feet from you and another one 100 yards away, their relative size would be extremely different. Or if you took a real pool ball and set it 10 feet away, then paint a beach ball to look like that pool ball and put that some distance away, you could make it seem like they're side by side.  \n\nThat's not giving you a false impression of their relative size, but of their actual size.",

    "text": "Is the sentence in the title correct? Actually, I said this to a friend who was enjoying the plot of a novel that she is halfway through. That was a response to her declaration that if the story continues as she's hoping. She'll buy other works of the same author. \n\n\n\nThanks as always! ",
    "comments": [
      "> **It seems to me that** you loved this **author‚Äôs narrative style** in the ~~previous~~ pages **leading up to** this decisive juncture in the plot. \n\nMy strongest objection is to ‚ÄúIt feels that.‚Äù Using ‚Äúfeel‚Äù in an impersonal expression like this is a bit odd. You could potentially use ‚ÄúIt feels like,‚Äù but even that is a bit colloquial given the tone of the rest of the sentence.\n\nThe rest of my corrections are mainly stylistic.",
      "Is it the *narration* that you think your friend enjoyed, or the *story*? Everything else outside the use of the word ‚Äúnarration‚Äù makes me think that she likes the characters and the story and she hopes she‚Äôs right about what direction it‚Äôs going in.\n\nNarration is a more specific aspect of a story where the storyteller themselves is describing what is happening. We usually talk about narration when we talk about the style or angle of the delivery of the story rather than its contents. Some novels are narrated by one of the characters in the novel itself which either gives us insight into their own motivations or potentially skews the story ‚Äî unreliable narrators have been a storytelling device for a long time.\n\nIf I‚Äôm not wrong in saying all this, then the word you were going for might have been *narrative*, but I think *story* is much more natural in casual speech. I would‚Äôve said ‚ÄúI‚Äôm glad you really love this story even before knowing what direction it will go in‚Äù",
      "It's a little confusing, because the way you have written it makes me expect some sort of change. Basically, \"you liked it before the juncture\", so I'm prepared to hear something about her not liking it after the juncture. But your explanation makes it clear that she very much likes the book so far without any qualifiers. So I think you've decorated your comment too much.\n\nI'll echo another commenter about the \"It feels that\" part. I think you either own the feeling, e.g. \"I feel like...\", or you use \"It seems like...\" or even \"it sounds like...\". In this usage, you'd almost always hear \"like\" rather than \"that\" even though \"that\" probably feels more grammatical. \"That\" tends to add formality or sound like one is trying to be very precise, but in such a casual conversation, that probably wouldn't be desired.\n\nFinally, this is more verbose that a native speaker would be for such a conversation. So, if I've captured the intent, I would have said something like\n\n\"It seems like you really enjoy this author's style.\"\n\n\"It seems like you've enjoyed this book so far.\"\n\n\"It seems like you're really enjoying this book.\"\n\n\"It sounds like you really like his/her/their \\[pick the appropriate pronoun\\] narrative style based on what you've read so far.\" And really, the last bit would probably go unstated: \"It sounds like you really like their style so far.\"\n\nIf you really want me to stick close to your original, I'd probably say (dropping the \"this author\" because that's strongly implied):\n\n\"It sounds like you've really enjoyed the narration up to this point in the story.\"",
      "Thanks for making me aware of my mistakes! I now understand that using *feel* in this situation is wrong because I'm talking to a person who isn't very close. Is the part *in the previous pages before reaching* absolutely wrong? I know your suggestion sounds more natural but could you give your opinion about my original sentence?",
      "Our conversation regarding the book was very short and I implied from her excitement that she liked the narration as well as the theme it's based on. She didn't disclose much about it only to not spoil it for me but she did tell me it is about people of colour and its name, Sula by Tim Morrison.",
      "I had written *the decisive juncture* because it's the point in the novel where my friend would've decided if she'll buy other novels by this author or not. Basically, she was enjoying the flow of how the story is progressing so far and expects it to end well.",
      "It‚Äôs not absolutely incorrect, but it is quite awkward. At the very least, I would delete ‚Äúin the previous pages;‚Äù it‚Äôs implied by ‚Äúbefore.‚Äù",
      "Ah, gotcha. Although you *inferred* that from her excitement. She implied it.",
      "Right, but was it a special juncture in the plot, or just accidentally where her bookmark was at that moment? Like, was she saying\n\n\"This book has been really good til now, but it's reached a point where the two main characters need to learn to cooperate or destroy each other's lives, and in the past my experience is that when the author lets them destroy each other, I lose interest. So I'm really hoping that this time they learn to cooperate.\"\n\nIf it's that kind of juncture, then it makes sense to call it out. She is explicitly making this plot juncture her decision point. But if it's just, \"I've really liked it so far and I hope that continues\", then it has nothing to do with a plot juncture.\n\nI guess what I'm saying is that \"juncture\" is a very conspicuous word choice.",
      "[deleted]",
      "Yes! Since she's *clear* about her feelings for this book and I understood it based on that. It needs to be *infer* due to this reason, right?",
      "I've an inkling that she didn't want to spoil it for me as I had asked her for recommendations. She only told me about what inspired her to pick this book without revealing much about the plot. She did, however, enthusiastically say that she's loving the book so far and if its story unfurls the way she's predicted she'll order more novels of the same author from Amazon.",
      "They‚Äôre about the same. You can swap them out interchangeably.",
      "Well that‚Äôs one thing, for sure ‚Äî if she‚Äôs saying it directly then she‚Äôs not implying it. If she does not say it directly, but you can still tell that it‚Äôs true based on what she does say, she is implying it. \n\nThe point I was making is that if *you* imply something, which is the way you worded it, then you indirectly get across (presumably to your friend) something you mean without saying it directly. So the problem is that in this situation, you‚Äôre getting who‚Äôs doing the implying backward; she‚Äôs the one implying her experience of the book, not you. \n\nOn the other hand, if you are *interpreting* the things she says to mean things she is not saying directly ‚Äî in other words, you believe you recognise something she is implying ‚Äî then you would be *inferring* that from her words. That‚Äôs what inferring means. So in that situation, she‚Äôs implying it and you‚Äôre inferring it.",
      "Okay, well, you know the context better than I, so you are the ultimate arbiter of what's \"right\". All I will say as a native English speaker is that \"juncture\" is conspicuous in that sentence, so it should probably be very relevant, otherwise \"point\" might do the job just as well."

      "Definitely both regional and circumstantial. I‚Äôd say ‚Äúfren-duv-mine‚Äù typically.",

Those sounds do experience a lot of mutation, \"t\" often slides into \"d\", \"d\" often slides into a something almost like an \"n\", but I think it's very rare that they are actually silent. \n\nHere's an example (based on my own dialect at least). Pronounce the phrase \"own go\" (I know that doesn't make a sentence, but just pretend it could be part of a sentence and pronounce it as such). Now consider the phrase \"don't go\" (again, imagine how it would sound if it were in an actual sentence). The \"don\" in \"don't go\" sounds exactly like the \"own\" in \"own go\", but \"don't go\" sounds different than \"own go\". There's a little stop in \"don't go\". So even though you don't hear a \"t\", the \"t\" is definitely not silent. Or if you want to call it silent, you still must acknowledge that it has an effect on the surrounding sounds. So taking this silent rule too seriously would actually damage your pronunciation.\n\nWhen those letters do become silent, it's because of a clash with a following letter. \"Stand tall\" sounds pretty much like \"stan tall\", but that's obviously because of the awkwardness of \"d\"+\"t\" right next to each other.",

Like a warplane.\n\nI think the def for \"Bite the bullet\" (Meaning: To endure something unpleasant) is confusing. It's about *preparing* to endure something, not about enduring it.\n\nTo \"take responsibility\" isn't necessarily taking the blame. It can be just taking charge.\n\n\"Plausible\" is more about something being *possible*, rather than probable. It's usually about something that is rather unlikely.\n\n\"The ball is in your court\" isn't exactly saying it's your responsibility. It's more about saying, it's your \"turn\" to take action. You are the one who can decide about something.\n\n\"Take it with a grain of salt\" isn't telling you to not take it seriously. It's saying that the information may be bogus; you should be skeptical. (Also, it's often a *pinch* of salt.)\n\nI don't think I've ever heard someone say they'll \"hit the books\" (to study), but you can *hit* pretty much anything that you intend to focus on. We can \"hit the town\" - go out, or \"hit the McDonald's\", etc.\n\n\"Face the music\" doesn't mean you *accept* the consequences. It just means you have to deal with the results of something; face judgement.\n\n\"Burn bridges\" isn't always about relationships. It can be anything. Like quitting a job and telling the boss to fuck off, for example.\n\n\"Call it a day\" isn't necessarily about work. We often use that phrase when leaving any random thing. A party, a football game, whatever.\n\n\"Hit the ground running\" isn't about enthusiasm. It's about being ready to immediately begin.\n\nThe rest of the idioms look OK.\n\nI haven't looked at the vocab. I may do later.",

I think it would be more correct to say \"If I find out that you didn't do your homework yesterday, I will get angry.\"\n\nPlacing a conditional on someone in the past doesn't make logical sense, and getting angry isn't a process with a lot of steps, so there's probably no need to say you're \"starting\" it.",

You‚Äôre going to be angry _if you find out_ that they didn‚Äôt do the homework.\n\nAnd partly because we don‚Äôt often talk about the onset of the process of getting angry. We talk about the state of being angry and the state of becoming angry, but it seems odd to predict that there will be a moment in the future when you are going to start getting angry. It‚Äôs cleaner to predict either that you will be in a state of growing anger, or that you will be at a specific level of anger.¬†\n\nWhich is the other thing: it feels odd to just say you will be angry - that‚Äôs sort of a wide ranging emotion. Some sort of description of how angry is almost mandatory. You‚Äôll be really angry, or furious, or a little bit angry, or so angry.¬†\n\nSome alternative phrasings that might feel more natural:\n\nFor the first clause:\n\n‚ÄúIf it turns out you didn‚Äôt do your homework yesterday‚Äù\n\n‚ÄúIf you haven‚Äôt done yesterday‚Äôs homework‚Äù\n\n‚ÄúIf you didn‚Äôt actually do your homework yesterday‚Äù\n\n‚ÄúIf I find out you didn‚Äôt do your homework yesterday‚Äù\n\nFor the second clause:\n\n‚ÄúI‚Äôm going to start getting angry‚Äù\n\n‚ÄúI‚Äôm going to be furious‚Äù\n\n‚ÄúI‚Äôll start getting cross‚Äù\n\nAlso you can flip the clauses and it maybe feels more natural to be less wordy:\n\n‚ÄúI‚Äôll be angry if you didn‚Äôt do your homework yesterday‚Äù",

You can say someone is 'punny' if they're good at making puns (combination of pun + funny), but you'd generally 'make puns'. People would likely still understand you using pun as a verb, but it's not really proper.\n\nI don't really have any advice about actually making puns, I'm not very witty either :(",

See [https://www.reddit.com/r/puns/comments/1crt1uc/website\\_to\\_help\\_generate\\_puns/](https://www.reddit.com/r/puns/comments/1crt1uc/website_to_help_generate_puns/)\n\nYour example seems more to be a garden-path sentence because the grammatical structure needs to be recategorized.\n\n[https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pun](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pun)\n\nbreaks down different types of puns.\n\nAdding: Punning may be a developmental skill.\n\nIf you google this, county fair kids jokes\n\nyou'll find the Iowa state fair contest.

      "I think one of the main things is to be aware when a word or combination of words has more than one meaning, *could* take on a different meaning if you changed the context, or sounds (more or less) like something else with a separate meaning. A native speaker might do this unconsciously but you can learn to do it too.\n\nFor example, if you see the idiom \"up to something\" (doing something sneaky), also consider what those words mean literally (i.e., going physically in an upwards direction towards something). Many words/idioms in English either have other meanings or sound like others that have different meanings, though of course not all of these will present obvious opportunities for humour. But the more you think laterally, the more likely you'll be able to notice possibilities.\n\n*Why did 6 fear 7? Because 7 8 9 (seven eight [= sounds like ate] nine).* <-- there are tons of this kind of basic pun based purely on homonyms with different meanings, and they're probably the easiest place to start.",

But perhaps this distinction between wordplay and pun isn't universal.\n\n\nAlso, it's possible that wordplay is not as common in English (at least, in America where I'm from) than it is in your home culture. Based off how my Japanese roommate described Japan, it sounds like wordplay is much more common in Japan than it is in the US.",
      "Make lists of homophones (words that sound the same but mean different things). All you have to do to make a pun is get creative with replacing or combining those words.",

      "Crikey! that's a hard one\n\nI think that it's unanimous and consensus as they are an adjective and noun pair that are  related to the same concept in the same way as vindictive and revenge.\n\nall the others are also adjective noun pairs but are opposites, unrelated or only tenuously related.",
      "I think it‚Äôs the first one\n\nThe example gives an adjective and a noun which are semantically linked\n\nSo if you are unanimous, you have consensus\n\n(A response does not have to be thoughtful)",
      "I'd go for the top one but this is a fucking awful question.",
      "I'm pretty sure it's unanimous to consensus.\n\nArtful to rendition kind of works but I think it's the worse answer.",
      "Thoughtful leads to response. \n\nWhy? \n\nVindictiveness is a mindset which provokes revenge. \n\nThoughtfulness is a mindset which provokes a response.\n\n\nBut I can see E being true for the same reason.",
      "I had to think about this a lot, but my reasoning is renditions don‚Äôt have to be artful; responses don‚Äôt have to be thoughtful; quandaries don‚Äôt have to be moral, and humility can‚Äôt be haughty, but revenge does have to be vindictive. That leaves consensus as the best option, which doesn‚Äôt have to be unanimous, but does at least have to approach it. Saying ‚Äúunanimous consensus‚Äù is essentially a tautology (or close enough) as would be saying ‚Äúvindictive revenge,‚Äù so, I‚Äôm going with that one.",
      "I think the last one, Artful Rendition. The definition of \"Vindictive\" means \"prone to revenge\", so it's a pairing of adjective and noun where they both mean the same thing. Haughty and Humility are out because those meanings are contradictory. Consensus, Quandary, and Response are often Unanimous, Moral, or Thoughtful, but they don't have to be. A Rendition though has to be Artful (to use one meaning of the term meaning a performance or depiction)",
      "Vindictive (adjective) is to Revenge (noun) as Unanimous (adjective) is to Consensus (noun).\n\nVindictive and Revenge are connected because they both relate to the idea of \"revenge.\" Unanimous and Consensus are connected because the both realte to the idea of \"agreement.\"",
      "I'd pick #4, though I'm not completely comfortable with it. \"Vindictive\" is a feeling, and \"revenge\" is action based on that feeling. #1 is the closest match for the relationship between the two words, but \"unanimous\" is not a feeling. \n\n\"Thoughtful\" is a feeling and \"response\" is an action that could result, so that's a match. I'm not happy with it because while you wouldn't seek revenge without feeling vindictive, you can certainly give a response that's not thoughtful. So to me there are two bad choices, and I picked the one I think is least bad.",
      "Thoughtful is to Response.",
      "I don‚Äôt think any of them work.\n\n‚ÄúVindictive‚Äù is the adjective that describes ‚Äúrevenge‚Äù, and they two words are inherently paired. Revenge is by definition a vindictive act. A vindictive act is by definition an act of revenge.\n\n‚ÄúUnanimous‚Äù can describe ‚Äúconsensus‚Äù, but not always - a consensus means an agreement, but it may only mean a majority opinion, not a unanimous opinion.\n\n‚ÄúHaughty‚Äù and ‚Äúhumility‚Äù are opposites.\n\n‚ÄúMoral‚Äù can describe a ‚Äúquandary‚Äù, but it isn‚Äôt the only kind of quandary.\n\n‚ÄúThoughtful‚Äù can describe a ‚Äúresponse‚Äù, but it isn‚Äôt the only type of response.\n\n‚ÄúArtful‚Äù could describe ‚Äúrendition‚Äù, but it‚Äôs not the only type of rendition.\n\nIf I had to pick, I‚Äôd pick ‚Äúunanimous‚Äù and ‚Äúconsensus‚Äù, but it‚Äôs weird because unanimous is not an adjective that inherently describes what consensus means, and vindictive does inherently describe revenge. But, it‚Äôs at least fair to say that if there is a decision that is unanimous, there is consensus, even if it‚Äôs not true the other way around like is true for vindictive and revenge.",
      "Moral is to quandary is really funny lol",
      "This thread is neither UNANIMOUS nor in CONSENSUS",
      "I lean toward \"thoughtful/response.\"  Vindictive and thoughtful are both states of mind; revenge is an action that can give effect to vindictiveness, and response is an action that can give effect to thoughtfulness.",
      "Ok so vindictive is of someone or something that is prone to or enjoys revenge.\n\n\nA consensus requires a majority but is often unanimous. \n\nHaughty is someone not inclined toward humility. Definitely not that.\n\nA quandary is often moral in nature, but they aren‚Äôt innately associated.\n\nA response is often thoughtful, but they aren‚Äôt innately associated.\n\nA rendition is innately artistic in nature, but artful would only apply to a good rendition. \n\n\nI think it‚Äôs either the first or last. None of these have the exact implications of vengeful and revenge as a pair but those are the closest to that innate pairing. \n\nI lean in favor of artful to rendition, because the ideal form of a rendition is innately artful but I honestly can‚Äôt tell. \n\n\nNot to blame test makers for my own shortcomings but with two nearly exact matches like that I do wonder a little if there may have been a mixup with the exact implications of the words on those last two."

He presents ideas, worlds really, full of things (and words) that we've never seen before. There's no easy way to get through this.

You get used to the writing, the world, the situation... and so it is easier to guess. There are some novels where I spent a day on the first page, a day on the next ten pages, then fifteen pages... but then I managed to read the last 200 pages in a day.\n\n\nSeries are a smart choice because normally you get more for free when you start with a new book, than if you had chosen an entirely new book.\n\n\nSomething that helped me in some situations, was reading a bit around about for example worbuilding, or situation, or characters, in a language you understand.

    "text": "In this sentence after the comma sentence started without subject. I need to understand one thing. Does that grammer rule mean;\n\nWe used to poison you by accident [we used to wipe out] all of villages with sickness\n\nOr\n\nWe used to poison you by accident we used to wipe out by giving the wrong thing or sth.\n\nWhat i was trying to ask is that -ing thing is because of deleted subject or something else?\n",
    "comments": [
      "That -ing ending marks the participle, which usually modifies the nearest noun, though in this case I'd say it probably modifies the \"we.\" It turns a noun phrase like \"wipe out all villages . . . \" into a modifier that acts like an adjective. You could think of it as \"We, wiping out all villages with sickness, used to poison you by accident.\" \n\nThat -ing ending can also mark the gerund, which turns a verb phrase into something that acts like a  noun: \"Wiping out entire villages is a morally reprehensible act.\" The two forms are grammatically different, but look exactly the same. You have to figure out which they are by context and the surrounding grammar, and it's something that native speakers sometimes struggle with explaining or recognizing (many English speakers have no idea what a \"gerund\" even is). \n\nSomething about the sentence also feels a little off to my native-speaker intuition, though I can't pin down what's wrong. I think it's that \"wiping out all villages\" sound odd. That doesn't feel like a natural use of \"all.\" I'd expect something like \"wiping out all of your villages\" or \"wiping out every village.\"",
      "So in your example, the \"-ing\" part (\"wiping out...\") is called a¬†**present participle phrase**, and it‚Äôs used to describe the result or manner of the main action. Here, it means the poisoning accidentally¬†*caused*¬†the villages to be wiped out. The subject isn‚Äôt deleted; it‚Äôs just implied to be the same as the main clause (\"we\").\n\nA simpler way to think of it:  \n*\"We poisoned you by accident, \\[and this resulted in\\] wiping out the villages...\"*",
      "A comma isn‚Äôt a period. Both clauses have a subject verb agreement.",
      "It‚Äôs a participle clause.  Present participle [wiping] means this action has the same subject [we] and happened at the same time as the action in the main clause.  \n‚ÄúWe poisoned you by accident, wiping out all of the villages.‚Äù  \n(I wouldn‚Äôt use ‚Äòused to‚Äô here).",
      "When you have an -ing verb at the beginning of the second clause like that, pretend there's a \"by\" or \"while\" before the verb: \"we used to poison you by accident [by] wiping out villages with sickness.\" \n\nI would say the adverb is omitted or implied. Either way, the second clause is closely related to the first clause, adding clarity and detail.",
      "The sentence is awkward. It's actually hard to parse without knowing what the speaker/writer was trying to emphasize. In fact, we might say that it's actually grammatically \"wrong\". Also, the \"accidentally\" clashes with a continuing behavior. Better might be:\n\n\"We poisoned you accidentally, wiping out all villages with sickness.\"\n\nThere is an implicit conjunction (I think that's what's missing anyway):\n\n\"We poisoned you accidentally, wiping out all villages with sickness \\[as a result\\].\"\n\nEven better might be:\n\n\"We poisoned you accidentally, and as a result wiped out all villages with sickness.\"\n\nSo, the part after the comma could be an independent clause (the conjunction being implicit) with \"wiping\" as the subject, or it could be a participle phrase that modifies \"to poison\".\n\nBasically, I think the original sentence is a bit sloppy from a grammatical point of view.",
      "Thanks",
      "So you are saying that both of these sentences i wrote is sort of correct?",
      "Thanks that was the answer i was looking for. Grammer books or native speakers don't know how to make me understand these subtle situations because in my language \"by wiping out\" or \" ... , wiping out\" means the same thing. However grammer books say by means of wiping out or by wiping out is verbose.",
      "The first one is closest to being grammatically correct but you would say ‚Äúall the villages‚Äù or just ‚Äúall villages.‚Äù\n\nThe second one has multiple issues that make it sound very jarring."

      "As an English teacher the thing I have found works the best with my students is getting them to watch a YouTube video, write everything they hear even if they can‚Äôt understand it or know what word they hear - just write the sound you hear. Do 5-10 seconds of the video at a time and watch each as many times as you need. Then once you‚Äôve got a good chunk done, correct it with your teacher or turn on the subtitles and confirm it. I do that with a few of my students and they‚Äôre improving very quickly",
      "Stop treating it as study or homework, just treat it as entertainment, find some podcasts you like, and listen for fun, watch movies for fun, watch YouTube/tik tok/ reels for fun,\n\nDon't stress about understanding every word, just enjoy it",
      "I don't have firsthand experience of learning English as a second language (I'm just a linguistics student), but I would imagine that watching videos with subtitles might be helpful. You could even close your eyes to see how much you're able to follow, and then if you encounter a word or phrase you're unsure of, open them again to check. Listening to videos or audio recordings at a slower speed (like maybe 0.5-0.75x) could help too. I also remember someone telling me once that there are some podcasts made specifically for English learners to practice their listening skills.\n\nThe 'listening wall' is a real phenomenon that second language learners experience. When we are learning our first language as babies, we don't have to worry about reading or writing or memorising complex rules. We just start with talking and listening to sounds. Now that you're learning a new language, you've done it the opposite way around, and your brain gets overwhelmed and confused more easily because it's a bit of an unnatural way to learn. But that's also why practicing speaking and listening is really important. It will help you take advantage of how your brain naturally wants to learn. Plus, listening to native speakers will also help you improve your accent, even if you don't completely understand every word.\n\nAlso, try to take some of the pressure off of yourself. Like another commenter said, it's ok if you miss words sometimes while you're learning. Try to find TV shows or other forms of media that you actually enjoy, and have fun. Stressing less will actually help you improve faster. \n\nGood luck and I hope you get a lot more helpful advice!",
      "Instead of \"studying,\" I just listen to tons of English podcasts and audiobooks every day. \n\nAt the beginning, I felt native speakers spoke way too fast to understand, but now I can understand them even when they speak quickly. Sometimes, I even need to increase the playback speed for YouTube videos to save time.\n\nMy listening comprehension has improved a lot, and I can understand American English pretty well. However, I sometimes still struggle with the British accent. I have British friends, and I probably should hang out with them more often!",
      "Maybe just need more time. To me, beside the vocabulary limitation, I did not see a wall. I watch a lot of Youtube videos everyday,  I can see my listening skill keeps improving, now for the educational content, news and vlogs, I can easily follow with 1.75+ speed. For real life conversation, I do not have any problem to follow. But 3 years ago, it was different, I found it hard to even catch the general meaning of a lecture.

      "I‚Äôm a native English speaker. Not sure if this will help but watch YouTube videos with captions and speed the video up and watch it. See if you can understand it and keep speeding it up until you understand it. I‚Äôm able to almost perfect understand videos that are 3.7x its normal speed.",
      "I faced similar problems - I studied English at school and it was ok-ish. I could have a simple conversation but I was not able to understand TV shows, YouTube videos, etc. \n\nI thought I plateaued in my progress but I was able to improve my skills tremendously over 2 years by teaching myself. \n\nHere is some advice that I would recommend, based on my own experience (so please don‚Äôt tell me *‚Äùthis is not how you should study English‚Äù* - it worked for me and I am positive that it will work for others)\n\n1- 45 min of grammar per day seems a bit excessive. Yes, grammar is important, but English is not so complex that it requires this much grammar exercise. I would reduce it to 30 min per WEEK. Use the time you save to *listen* and *speak* more and also learn idioms. \n\n2- What helped me improve my understanding of spoken English was watching videos and series with subtitles. And I don‚Äôt sit back and relax - I actually read the subtitles. If their spoken words don‚Äôt match the subtitles, I rewatch the scene over and over again until I understand what they are saying. \n\n3- don‚Äôt watch complicated stuff, like business podcasts as you mentioned in your post. Watch something that you actually enjoy. Baking videos, make up tutorials, reality tv etc. \n\n4- learning vocabulary and grammar with worksheets will only improve your skills by 5%. The remaining 95% come from using it in conversations. You need to be able to use grammar rules without thinking about it. \n\n5- And you need to speak way way way more. 1 hour per week doesn‚Äôt scratch the surface. What helped me: I became interested in gaming and was forced to join discord servers to play multiplayer games. But even if you‚Äôre not into gaming, I am certain that there are dc servers that connect you with native speakers to practise speaking. \n\n6- when you make a native speaker friend eventually, tell them to point out mistakes that you make while speaking. \n\n7- immerse yourself in this language. Set your phone and pc to English. Watch YouTube in English. Write grocery lists in English. Talk to your cat in English. (Yes I am serious) \n\n8- I know it‚Äôs not always possible, but get a job where you‚Äôre forced to speak English. \n\n9- when you select a tv show to watch, make sure it‚Äôs an American show. Their accents seem to be easier to understand for beginners. I made the mistake of watching a British show and all of them had a scouse accent which is hard to understand for inexperienced listeners. \n\n10- Time. It won‚Äôt come overnight. It took me 2 years to get from a high school level English to being very confident in my abilities.",

      "What activities, resources, or books do you use to study reading and vocabulary?",
      "That \"listening wall\" is real, especially with fast, natural speech. What helped me was focusing on narrow listening‚Äîrepeating the same podcast or interview multiple times. First with subtitles, then audio-only, and finally at a slower speed before going back to normal. It trains your ear gradually.\n\nAlso, try to listen actively even during chores: pick one speaker you like and stick with their voice until it becomes familiar.",

Your vowels are good, but still need some work. I'd look at an IPA vowel chart and work on shadowing words with special attention to the vowels and their placement in the mouth.",
      "The main thing I notice is the way you pronounce your *r*s. They're higher in the throat or closer to the front of the mouth than most Americans pronounce them, a bit like the way they're pronounced in French. When I try to mimic them, I put the back of my tongue close to the back of the roof of my mouth, somewhat closing off my throat. The way I pronounce *r* myself, on the other hand, has the tip of my tongue curled upwards toward but not touching the middle of the roof of my mouth. It produces a deeper *r* than yours. To practice, yoiu might try pretending to growl like a dog (though I know different languages represent dog sounds differently).\n\nHope that helps.",
      "I wonder if you can contact someone that's an actual expert in vocalization. I can definitely hear your accent, but other than play around with the sounds in my own mouth, I don't really know how to explain how to get closer to \"American English\" (whatever that is :) ). Or maybe there are places where actors learn accents. Or some sort of accent coach? FWIW, I didn't have any trouble understanding you. \n\nAnd I know you're focused on the accent, but if you were also interested in idioms and vocabulary, maybe that would be easier for folks here to help with.

You can practice with the word ‚Äúthough‚Äù but your tongue should never touch the roof of your mouth when saying ‚Äúthough‚Äù.

      "\"I'll be used to\" is close to future perfect tense (with a notion of continuation). I suppose the true future perfect tense would be \"I will have gotten used to\", but that might be quibbling. \"I will get used to\" is just simple future tense describing an ongoing activity occurring in the future. Both of these sound awkward out of context. In real world use, either of these sentences would probably have some emphasis added to specific words to clarify the intent in context.",

The second half is a bit easier, but it‚Äôs still, I feel, poorly written but for in academic circles.\n\nEffectively it‚Äôs saying that we can‚Äôt generalise musical interpretations. If we want to think about how someone might perceive a piece of music, it‚Äôs important to first figure out who is actually listening to the music. It starts with what culture are they part of, where are they from, but even if you account for that then you need to understand what level of education they have in music and how that changes their interpretation of it.\n\nTo me, like most academic texts, it‚Äôs a whole lot of words to say ‚Äúit depends‚Äù, which is why academic texts are so frustrating to read most of the time\n\nEdit: I think the answer is 3",

Nothing in the piece is describing the actions of communities or the *evolution* of their musical behaviors, just whether differences exist 3. The piece also isn't saying that varied perceptions are better or enriching, just that they exist to some extent. 5. Also sounds somewhat ungrammatical. Again, counts for what?\n\n4. Is the best. \"But\" sets up that the sentence is going to contrast the previous one, which is talking about disagreement in perception, and 4. is talking about how the commonalities outweigh \"the differences\", which ties directly to the previous sentence. The opening follows a similar structure: it starts with saying, yes there are differences in music perception, BUT almost everyone can find a beat. Yes, experts may have disagreements, BUT there are more commonalities than differences. 4. fits in best with the previous sentence and the thrust of the entire paragraph.",

So I searched on line for an assignment and I have made this one. Could somebody take a look at it? (By the way I already see three typo's because of course I did not use a spelling corrector. Of course it is: summarizes, focused and difficulty.)\n\n*You have just completed six months in a new job.

Write your report.*\n\n  \nHalf Year Progress Meeting\n\nThis report summerizes the results and achievements of my first six months in the role of Software Developer. It also indicates lack of knowledge experienced and makes suggestions about further education.\n\nAchieved Results\n\nThe first two months were mainly focussed on learning both the tools to develop the software and also the domain in which it operates. After this period I could help to develop some smaller components, first in pair programming, later independently. Now I am ready to take on some more complicated work.\n\nExperienced Problems\n\nThe main dificulty for me was getting the proper testing data to check my achieved work. It's a complicated system, with many different elements, or micro services, and to set them all up in fact takes more time than writing the code itself.\n\nFuture Training\n\nThere are two areas in which I would like to improve myself. First, I would like to develop more skills in writing testcode, in this way I can automatically test my work. Second, I would like to get to know the environment in which the software runs, the users, the domain. I hope that I can attribute to the functional specifications of the software, not only the technical implementation.\n\nFinally I would like to give my appreciation for all the help you have given me this period.

I think I might be very scatterbrained? When I try to write or speak so many images are in my head at once and I always stutter or have to change up the entire structure of the sentence. To give an example, even writing a simple diary entry in my native language will take me at least 1 hour, if I want to structure sentences properly. I‚Äôm literally 20 too, so no excuses.\n\nBut it‚Äôs also true that I‚Äôm slightly better at my native language than English. Also the way I make my sentences in English is different from how a native speaker would do it so that‚Äôs another thing I want to overcome.

Which of the two in the title do you think is my bigger problem? As in the thing I need to focus on more.\n2. Regardless of the answer for Q#1, I wanna get my English to a fluent level. Do you think starting with a grammar textbook is a good choice? After that I‚Äôm planning to straight out just transcribe books, multiple times until I almost memorize it.\n3.

That‚Äôs super common, especially if you‚Äôre not using English actively every day. The \"scatterbrained\" feeling when trying to form sentences? Relatable. üòÖ I‚Äôve found that practicing with shorter, simpler sentences first helps then slowly building up complexity.\n\nGrammar textbooks can help, but imo, they‚Äôre not the most fun or efficient way to improve fluency. Transcribing books is a cool idea though! Maybe try journaling in English too, even just a few sentences a day? It‚Äôs low-pressure and helps organize thoughts.\n\nFor pronunciation, it‚Äôs¬†definitely¬†not hopeless! Shadowing (repeating audio right after you hear it) has helped me a ton.¬†"

Some of these affect understanding, which leads to a lower assessment.  \nIn the writing section of CAE, CPE and academic IELTs, the challenge is often to write within the word limit, rather than to write enough.  Anyone who has studied at University or writes for work will be used to writing much longer texts.  \nBe aware that the writing sections of these exams are meant to simulate formal texts, but in much shorter form.  As a result, there is a large number of marks available for structure, and by the time you have written all the sentences you need to produce the expected structure - linkers, topic sentences, concluding sentences, examples, explication etc., you will already be close to the word limit.

She said this in front of my group and i felt devastated, and humiliated. \n\nAfter that, luckily I passed the finish exam, but I felt have a downgrade. I realized that I have to change this and improve my English, because not knowing this language is like have a body without an arm, in world when we are surrounding this culture (music, movies, memes etc.). My mental was focused on English like a school subject, and I wasn‚Äôt watch movies, series because I looked for translations on my native language. So I started watching series, movies because I tried thinking about English as something pleasant, interesting and giving me happiness. But this is really hard, because when I don‚Äôt understand a word, meaning of simple sentence or stop trying to translate to my native language, I remembering my traumas, hide back on my mind. I feel frustration and I want to cry.\n\nI don‚Äôt really know what can I do. I would like to change my perspective but it‚Äôs really difficult.

Don‚Äôt let a bad experience with this professor discourage you from reaching your goals. You are already most of the way there.\nI do have one suggestion. You mention watching series and movies in English, but it can be hard when you encounter words you don‚Äôt know. I‚Äôd recommend watching a series or movie you are already familiar with‚Äîpreferably one you‚Äôve watched multiple times‚Äîin English because the words you don‚Äôt know are easier to understand contextually in a story you already know.\nRegardless, don‚Äôt be too hard on yourself.

      "Hey Adam, I'm really sorry you went through such a negative experience with your teacher. Their behavior says more about their lack of empathy than your abilities. Everyone learns at their own pace, and making mistakes is *how* we learn.\n\nIt‚Äôs amazing that you‚Äôve already started to shift your mindset, like watching series and movies in English. If you're finding it hard not to translate everything, tools like FluentU might really help. It uses real-world videos like music videos, movie clips, and interviews, and shows you subtitles with word meanings right there, so you‚Äôre not constantly stopping to look things up (I've used it for years and now I help them with some admin staff too). You can also try Language Reactor (works with Netflix and YouTube) ‚Äî it gives you dual subtitles and lets you click on words for instant translations and explanations. Both tools help your brain slowly connect English directly with meaning, without needing to go through your native language all the time.\n\nAnd don't be afraid to enjoy things even if you don‚Äôt understand everything at first. Understanding builds over time. \n\nFinally, you absolutely deserve to learn English in a way that makes you feel respected and supported. You‚Äôre not alone‚Äîmany people have had to rebuild their confidence after bad school experiences. You *can* do this, step by step.\n\nSending you lots of encouragement! üåü",

      "A tip for retaining words: If you encounter a word in a book or movie you don't know, stop and look it up. Even if you don't remember the definition initially, you will after you look the same word up a few times. Having the action of looking the word up attached to the word helps remember the meaning. Wiktionary is a good resource, it has words in many many languages, both modern and ancient and it often includes outdated, dialectal, and other lesser used meanings that many dictionaries omit so when you occasionally find a word where the context doesn't make sense with any of the usual definitions it will help a lot. The only thing it's not great for is internet slang.\n\n\nIf you have trouble remembering the meanings of words still, write them down with their definitions and maybe some example sentences and that will help you absorb it.",

      "‚Äò(Be) on one‚Äô is an elegant and versatile phrase from informal British English.  It could have any number of meanings, all dependent on the context and shared understanding between speakers.  \n\nIn more detail:   In English, native speakers often prefer a preposition phrase to an adjective or adverb.  \nSo, instead on ‚Äòtimely‚Äô - ‚Äòon time‚Äô.  Instead of ‚Äòtopical‚Äô - ‚Äòon topic‚Äô etc.  \n\nThese can use any preposition, not just ‚Äòon‚Äô.  Some of the meanings can be quite idiomatic.  ‚ÄòUnder the table‚Äô for example, can describe the position of something, or it can describe something (especially a payment) which is done covertly or secretly.  \n\nIn informal spoken English, there are many phrases with ‚Äòon + noun phrase‚Äô which describe activities / states in progress:\n\nOn a bender - drinking a lot\nOn a promise - with a promise of sex later\nOn a pill - after having taken an illegal drug like ecstasy.\nOn a break - in the process of having a break (perhaps from a relationship)\nOn a streak / on a roll - having a period of good luck.  \nEtc.  \non a rampage - moving around in a wild, uncontrolled and destructive way.\nOn a rant - speaking in an impassioned and angry way.  \n\nIn English, ‚Äòone‚Äô can be used to substitute for a countable noun:\nA:  ‚ÄúDo you have a spare pen.‚Äù  \n\nB:  yeah\n\nA:  ‚ÄúCan you give me one.‚Äù  (One = spare pen)\n\nNotice that the noun referred to is dependent on the context.  \n\nThus \n‚ÄúI‚Äôm on one‚Äù can mean any of these prepositional phrases which contains a countable noun.  \n\nIt often means ‚Äúon a rampage‚Äô - in the course of violent, destructive behaviour.  ‚ÄúHe‚Äôs gone off on one.‚Äù  (He is in the course of another period of violent, destructive behaviour.\n\nOr it often means ‚Äúon a bender‚Äù - in the course of a drinking / partying / drugs binge.  ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs Friday night, let‚Äôs get on one!‚Äù  \n\nIt all depends on the shared understanding between the speakers.  With one friend, if I said ‚ÄúI‚Äôm on one‚Äù it would mean drinking a lot.  With another, it would mean I am in the mood to talk about something with passion and anger.  \n\nThis makes it very versatile.  \n\nYou need to examine the context to figure out what your song means.",
      "Your definition sounds right but I couldn't find a relevant dictionary entry. None of the examples in your free dictionary link use the literal word \"one\".\n\nI've definitely heard this expression though. I tried to search in COCA for idiomatic usage examples but that didn't help as there are so many irrelevant usages where \"one\" is just used as an determiner like in \"he 's on one of his personal missions\".",
      "googling the lyrics tells me this is Korean rapper JENNIE's song \"Start a War\"\n\n>I'm not sayin' we ain't got problems, Know that we could both be on one, But if somebody try to start some, I'm gon' try for you, I'll fight for you, go off for you, I'll start a war",
      "If you downvoting this, you should do one.",
      "What you said is a good example,\n\n> \"He's on one of his personal missions\"\n\nIt implies that he often goes on missions, and he is currently doing a mission.\n\nIt's usually hyperbole. Exaggeration.\n\nHe - maybe your friend - often gets fixated on a \"mission\" - which might be getting fit, or beating a computer game, or green energy or Thai cooking... anything from the mundane to the extreme. Such things can be described as \"a mission\", and some people tend to become somewhat obsessed by that one thing.\n\nSo... if a person is like that - susceptible to doing \"missions\" - it can be shortened to saying \"He's on one\". It's saying that his current activities are typical of his behavioural pattern, because he often becomes fixated on one thing.\n\nBut people also become fixated on drinking, or taking drugs, \"going on a bender\" - and that is also often described as being \"on one\".\n\nOr even someone who has a strong opinion, and sometimes rants about it. Like... say, somebody who hates Trump. They're normally perfectly nice to chat to, but sometimes they start ranting about politics and injustice and immigration and ... they're \"on one\".\n\nIt's *usually* used in a negative sense. \"Ignore John; he's on one today\".\n\nHe is on one of his regular tirades or extreme behaviours.\n\nI hope you can understand that the two uses are directly related.\n\nI don't know which one the singer intends; I can only speculate.\n\nThink of it as \"on one of those rants\" that he often goes on. One of many. Some type of abnormal behaviour which is recurrent for him. Drinking, arguing, obsessing... it's almost always negative."

      "\"...on your <verb>ing\" is an uncommon construction, but I see it once in awhile.\n\nI think \"...on you telling me the truth\" would be grammatically correct, but a bit awkward. \"I insist that you tell me the truth\" would be more natural.",
      "The pronoun \"you\" could work, and it‚Äôs what most people would say in this context nowadays.\n\nBut the more accurate pronoun to use would be \"your,\" which is in the possessive case. The reason for this is that the thing that is being insisted on is the person's act of telling the truth, not the person themself.\n\nBut once again, this construction with the possessive case is hardly used nowadays as it can sound stilted and formal. To avoid it, people typically use the objective case (\"you\") or just rephrase the sentence, like so:\n\n\"As your lawyer, I insist that you tell me the truth.\"",
      "It's a fancy way of saying something like \"I insist on your cooperation\" vs. \"I insist on you cooperating\" vs. \"I insist that you cooperate.\"\n\nLikewise, \"I insist on your paying attention\" and \"I insist you paying attention\" and \"I insist you pay attention.\"\n\nThe idea is that there's an intangible thing that is \"telling the truth\" and that it belongs to you. And that person is insisting you give that \"telling the truth\" to him.",
      "This is --to me-- correct, but somewhat stilted English. The construction you're looking for, and that I would write, is \"I insist that you tell me the truth.\" You can't really 'insist on' a person in this sense, you would instead insist on someone *doing* a thing, in this case \"telling the truth\". The meaning is slightly different though, as there's some ambiguity my way whether or not the person tell the truth in just this one instance rather than from that point forward. The way it's written above strongly implies the latter. An important distinction for a lawyer, but not very natural sounding to a layperson.",
      "Either one is fine. \n\nI insist on you telling me the truth is more informal. \n\nI insist on your telling me the truth is more formal. It‚Äôs possibly also more British but then as an American that may just be that I associate these more elegant structures with Standard British English.",

      "Using \"your\" is the only correct version of the sentence.\n\nThe reason is that \"the truth\" belongs to the person. Telling (with the \"ing\" suffix) is a gerund, or a verb used as a noun.\n\nSo, the sentence places importance on telling the truth.\n\nWhen you place a pronoun before a gerund, the action belongs to the person who needs to tell the truth.

Unfortunately, this particular example isn't very useful if you're trying to learn English. The word \"guise\" isn't used frequently, you may never hear it used outside of \"under the guise of\" or \"in the guise of\". In other constructs, you'd probably be more likely to use \"disguise\". Also, \"sabotage their grades\" is kind of shorthand. It's definitely understandable, but it's not aligned perfectly with the meaning of \"sabotage\". Grades are an output of some effort/plan, and so you can't really sabotage grades (well, unless you had access to the grade database, I guess). You can sabotage the effort to do something. For example, you could sabotage their study session by turning off the air conditioning (if they're studying in summer), which would make it harder for them to study because the heat would be uncomfortable. What \"sabotage their grades\" really means is \"sabotage their effort to get good grades\".",
      "You are studying some really niche English, I gotta say. What‚Äôs the goal here?  Is it ESL? Or are you trying to boost your (native speaker) vocab?",

      "I wouldn't say it's 'niche'. I knew all the words but 'guise' (and I had stumbled upon 'disguise'). I'm roughly C1. This particular person has been trying to trick someone into doing their homework for a while",

For an ESL learner, I would question why knowing ‚Äúguise‚Äù and ‚Äúsabotage‚Äù (or most of the other words in the answers here) is a priority. Also the scenarios on these sentences sound like they come from a dystopian Business seminar.",
      "It's not a priority, but it such words are often encountered in high-level exams. I've also started to wonder what this test is."

It does sound like very natural speech in English.\n\n**The longer answer**\n\nGenerally speaking, the answer is \"kind of.\" Language in RPGs, and much fiction, are often \"heightened\" and stylized to some degree and even get stuff wrong. For example, fiction in \"medieval\"-seeming settings ape but hardly replicate early modern English, and they don't even touch \"old English\" or \"Middle English,\" which can seem like foreign languages compared to the modern version.\n\nEven \"realistic\" and modern stories may take liberties with the language. In another example, Cyberpunk 2077 is peppered with fictionalized slang terms like \"choom\" and \"corpo.\" With that said, I'm fairly certainly I've see people online use the term \"corpo\" from time to time, probably under the influence of that game.\n\nEDIT: Clarifying text.",

      "When we say a language name like \"English\" or \"French\", it's ambiguous if we're talking about a noun (the language) or an adjective (describing the country). For example: I have a Portuguese teacher. Is the teacher from Portugal? Or do they teach the Portuguese language? It's unclear, just from my sentence.\n\nUsually, context makes things clear. But if you introduce something like \"an English novel\", it's technically unclear if you mean \"this is a novel written in English\" or \"this is a book written in England\", or even \"this is a novel written in a style typical of England\".\n\nIt's up to you if you think your meaning is clear in your sentence. Personally, I think \"a novel written in English\" is clearer. But on its own, \"English-language\" or similar phrases are absolutely fine to use.",
      "Both can be fine, but it's sometimes useful to clarify you're talking about \"English the language\" rather than \"English from England\"",
      "an English novel is a novel from England (ie as opposed to an American novel)\n\nnormally we would refer to an english-language novel as just ‚Äúa novel‚Äù unless there was reason to believe it might be written in some other language. \n\n‚Äúenglish-language novel‚Äù and ‚Äúnovel in english‚Äù are both basically the same. i think i might use ‚Äúenglish-language novel‚Äù for formal writing.",
      "The most natural phrase would be \"I'm writing a novel\" and not bothering to specify the language. If you're speaking English to another English speaker it's generally unnecessary to specify that the novel is also in English. You could also say \"I'm writing a novel in English\" if you think there's a reason your novel would reasonably be assumed to be in another language.\n\nAll that said, it's pretty suspect to say you're writing a novel in *any* language and also a ChatGPT user in the same breath. It makes us wonder if you're really just getting a computer to spit out a few thousand words.",
      "\"An English-language novel\" or \"A novel in English\" are both totally clear. The former sounds more professional, the latter more conversational, but there's not much in it. There's some ambiguity in \"an English novel\", because of the country. I wouldn't jump on it as flagrantly wrong but it requires a bit of context to be understood.",
      "As others have mentioned, without context, \"English novel\" could be taken to mean an English (as in the country) novel. \n\nMost native speakers would probably say \"I started writing a novel in [language] called...\" You could also use \"titled\" here, but both \"titled\" and \"called\" are interchangeable in this instance.",
      "\"Began\" sounds too formal in that usage, but it works. I think \"I started writing...\" or \"I started to write...\" would be much more common. \"Called\" works fine in a lot of constructions in place of \"titled\" or \"named\", but since you're writing the novel, I think \"titled\" is actually better here. (I'm referring to American English here, I hear \"called\" a lot more frequently in British English.) As for the hyphenated \"English-language\", that's just a special construction to make an adjective phrase when the individual words don't stand on their own as adjectives. So, you can't write a \"language novel\", but you can write an \"English-language novel\". But it's not required, and a lot of people would consider it an unnecessary affectation. I.e. \"English language novel\" is fine. Also, \"English novel\" could be interpreted as \"novel set in England\" or \"novel written by an English author\".",
      "What makes sense to me is that if I'm talking about the language, I don't capitalize the first letter (english), but if it's a nationality, \"English\". So I would write \"an english novel\" but to be honest I don't think a lot of people make this distinction",

      "When anthropomorphize any object, I do tend to use lady as it is a little bit more formal. In this case, you can call the train any of those you want, a girl, a lady or a woman would all technically be correct. Many earlier vessels were called with it because men would stay on them for months at a time. This isn‚Äôt quite the issue it used to be.",

Maybe that‚Äôs because a lot of the time characterizing/anthropomorphizing objects happens most commonly in kids' media. Kids‚Äô stories often have child characters, and children often call even grown adults ‚Äúboys/girls‚Äù so maybe that‚Äôs why calling a object character ‚Äúman‚Äù or ‚Äúwoman‚Äù sounds so strange.\n\n\nAlso if you say just ‚Äúgirl‚Äù or ‚Äúwoman‚Äù etc. without some context, people will always assume you mean a human. If you said ‚Äúthe girl in this book‚Äù I would wonder what in the world you're talking about because it‚Äôs about a train. ‚ÄúThe main character is a girl train‚Äù makes sense albeit still weird over just saying ‚Äútrain‚Äù",

As you get used to that, add a vowel at either end (eg. athsa) start slow holding the hiss a slowly get faster. Add more sounds at either end.\n\nI taught many first year linguists articulatory phonetics and EAL speakers diction with this method and its worked so far. It's learning to feel where your tongue and mouth are and working from there. It feels strange at first but you start to learn to make sounds you couldn't before.\n\nIf you struggle with the th sound at first, stick your tongue out a bit further and blow past your teeth, or start with s and move to th with the same exercise until you start to get used to the sound.",

With those words for me, I say the TH sound in a slightly different spot that's easier to get to the S from and it sort of ends up a TH-S'y mash, but they're one syllable in these words so the sounds are supposed to flow together.

We did not get rid of every reference to miles/inches/etc when we changed measurement system, and at least in the UK most people are pretty familiar with the Imperial system and prefer it for certain applications despite using metric generally.",

For example:\n\n- ‚ÄúI‚Äôm high key excited for the concert‚Äù (I‚Äôm very obviously excited)\n- ‚ÄúThat restaurant is high key overpriced‚Äù (It‚Äôs definitely/clearly overpriced)\n- ‚ÄúShe‚Äôs high key talented‚Äù (She‚Äôs obviously very talented)\n\nBoth terms let you express intensity while maintaining a casual, conversational tone. ‚ÄúLow key‚Äù adds a sense of understated honesty, while ‚Äúhigh key‚Äù adds emphatic clarity without sounding too formal or dramatic.‚Äã‚Äã‚Äã‚Äã‚Äã‚Äã‚Äã‚Äã‚Äã‚Äã‚Äã‚Äã‚Äã‚Äã‚Äã‚Äã  \n  \n- \n  \n\nThe traditional use of ‚Äúlow-key‚Äù (often hyphenated or written as two words) has several meanings that older generations would be more familiar with:\n\n**Subdued or understated:** ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre having a low-key celebration for her birthday‚Äù - meaning a quiet, small, or casual gathering rather than a big party.\n\n**Secretive or discreet:** ‚ÄúThey‚Äôre keeping their relationship low-key‚Äù - meaning they‚Äôre not making it public or drawing attention to it.\n\n**Relaxed or calm:** ‚ÄúI prefer low-key evenings at home‚Äù - meaning peaceful, quiet activities rather than high-energy or dramatic ones.\n\n**Not intense or demanding:** ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs a low-key job‚Äù - meaning it‚Äôs not stressful or high-pressure.\n\n**Modest or humble:** ‚ÄúShe has a very low-key personality‚Äù - meaning someone who doesn‚Äôt seek attention or make a big deal of themselves.\n\nIn these traditional uses, ‚Äúlow-key‚Äù is typically used as an adjective to describe nouns (low-key party, low-key person), whereas in Gen Z slang, it‚Äôs become more of an adverb that modifies feelings or opinions (‚ÄúI low key think‚Ä¶‚Äù). The core idea of ‚Äúnot intense‚Äù or ‚Äúunderstated‚Äù carries through both uses, but the grammatical function has shifted quite a bit.‚Äã‚Äã‚Äã‚Äã‚Äã‚Äã‚Äã‚Äã‚Äã‚Äã‚Äã‚Äã‚Äã‚Äã‚Äã‚Äã",
      "VERY age specific.   I‚Äôm in my 50‚Äôs and these sound awkward used as general adjectives.   ‚ÄúLow key‚Äù has been around for a long time, generally used to describe things, often an event or situation, that would not require much fuss, or should not have attention drawn to it - a low key meeting, a low key party, ‚Äúit was a low key affair for just a few friends and close family‚Äù ‚Äúlet‚Äôs keep it low key - don‚Äôt need a lot of people knowing‚Äù.    It would not have been used to describe objects or feelings‚Ä¶ ‚ÄúI‚Äôm low key concerned‚Äù doesn‚Äôt make any sense to older people.  ‚ÄúHigh key‚Äù is totally new/made-up, and even more non-sensical to anyone of my generation.  I see the connection, but it sounds ridiculous.",
      "Popping in to once again point out that these are African American Vernacular English words that have become a part of the American lexicon and are not simply Gen Z slang",
      "Thanks to everyone, I really learned a lot about the words.\n‚Ä¢ The word ‚Äúlowkey‚Äù mostly means ‚Äúnot very important‚Äù or ‚Äúnot very certain‚Äù about a subject.\n\n‚Ä¢ The word ‚Äúhighkey‚Äù is far less common since it‚Äôs a more recent creation, but it is sometimes used as the opposite of ‚Äúlowkey,‚Äù meaning ‚Äúvery important‚Äù or ‚Äúvery certain.‚Äù\n\n‚Ä¢ Both terms seem to come from words used in photography lighting, but there‚Äôs a possibility they originated from musical keys.\n\nÔΩ• The word ‚Äúlowkey‚Äù or ‚Äúlow key‚Äù was often used as an adjective (e.g., a low-key meeting), so its use as an adverb might confuse some people, especially older generations.\n\n\nLove you guys from Japan üòç",
      "They're borrowed from terminology around lighting - high key lighting has limited shadows. Low key lighting has high contrast, meaning there are dark shadows. The idea of dark shadows has been extended to mean things done \"in the shadows\", or secretly - so doing something in a \"low key\" way means that it's done in a way that is secret or doesn't attract notice. This use has been semantically bleached and now it's used in a way that it's more or less just an intensifier, but a bit of an odd one in that it still carries the implication of not wanting to draw attention to it. So one might say to a friend at a party \"I lowkey want to get out of here\", meaning they would really like to leave the party, but don't want to make a big deal about it.",
      "Lowkey means \"under the radar\" or \"not seeking attention.\" I've never heard anyone say highkey.",
      "Both are slang. Lowkey means it's something you're doing quietly, sneakily, under the table, etc. \n\nHighkey is more recent and means the opposite, something you're doing very publicly",
      "i've actually never read/heard \"high-key\" used in any media.\n\nlow-key means being modest. not showy. doesn't attract attention.\n\n\"No one noticed that the groom was low-key drunk during the wedding.\"",
      ">low-key *adv. - informal* (secretly, with embarrassment) \"I lowkey want to buy a pound of candy and spend the day eating it in bed.\"\n\n\nSource: Wordreference\n\n\n>Low-key¬†\n\n\n>informal : in a way or to a degree that is moderate or limited\n\n\n>It didn't take long for all of us to become low-key [=somewhat] obsessed with Lizzo ‚Ä¶\n\n\n>Everywhere we go, we're low-key [=casually] checking out coffee shops, parks, and window seats for maximum reading coziness.\n\n\n\n>High-key is a slang term meaning ‚Äútruly; completely; intensely,‚Äù often used to emphasize the sincerity or intensity of a statement. (Also high key, highkey.)\n\n\n>Examples of high-key\n\n\n>I highkey want a new job with more money! And I will get it.\n\n\n> ‚Ä¶ this is high key one of my favorite shows of all time ‚Ä¶\n\n\nSource: Merriam-Webster¬†",
      "Low key is not new at all.",
      "\"Lowkey\" means something is kinda true but not super strong or obvious - like \"I lowkey hate Mondays\" (I don‚Äôt really hate them, but... yeah, Mondays suck).\n\n\"Highkey\" is the opposite - when you feel something STRONGLY. Like \"I highkey love pizza\" (I‚Äôm obsessed, no shame). \n\nI learned them from TikTok tbh üòÖ At first I thought \"lowkey\" meant \"secretly,\" but it‚Äôs more like \"a little bit\" or \"not gonna lie.\"",
      "‚ÄúLow key‚Äù was a phrase that traditionally meant something was secret, subtle, or weak. Now Gen Z uses it as an all-purpose qualifier because they don‚Äôt want to be seen to make any definitive statement. As a result you often see it on sentences that would otherwise be expressing a high degree of confidence or emotion: ‚ÄúI think I‚Äôm low key in love with him.‚Äù ‚ÄúHe low key beat that guy to a pulp!‚Äù (My own generation does the same thing with ‚Äúlike.‚Äù) \n\nAnd therefore ‚Äúhigh key‚Äù is used as an intensifier when the Gen Z speaker gets past their natural human reticence and wishes to actually commit to a strong statement.",

      "\"Walking down the road\". \"Going down to the town\". \"Making my way down town, walking fast, faces pass and I'm homebound\" (shoutout Vanessa Carlton).\n\nDown is just another way of saying 'along' or 'across' or 'through'. Often there's no actual vertical element involved, but sometimes there is. If you're at the top of a hill, you walk \"down the hill\". But the word has evolved to basically mean the same as \"along\" or \"across\" to describe any kind of movement.\n\nSomewhat confusingly, \"up\" can normally replace \"down\" in sentences like this, though down is more common. \"Up\" tends to imply actual upward movement. You walk up a hill, or climb up a wall, but equally you can walk up a street. Up usually implies you're walking away from something though, if not physically upwards in space.",
      "\"Down\" and \"up\" have specific meanings in reference to a stage. I would assume that \"down the middle of the stage\" implies moving *downstage*, toward where the audience would be."

    "comments": [
      "\"I am not sure if it will continue\" is correct because in this case, the \"if\" is not a conditional. You're using \"if\" here for something that you're not sure about, the same way you'd use \"whether\". It's not a condition like \"if this, then that,\" so it won't follow the rules of a condition.",
      "In \"I am not sure if it will continue\", \"if\" isn't being used as something to form a conditional, it's been used as a synonym for \"whether\". \"I am not sure whether it will continue\" is a valid, non-conditional sentence.\n\nWhen \"if\" is being used to make a conditional, \"will\" is never in that clause.\n\n\"If I see you, I will leave.\"\n\n\"If her food has garlic, she'll have an allergic reaction.\"\n\n\"If you go, you'll find me there.\"\n\nSpecifically, this use of present-if and future-will is the predictive conditional, you use this when you're predicting the outcome of an event (\"if it rains, I won't drive\"), otherwise the other clause can be in present tense (\"if I leave my home, I lock the door\").",
      "\"I am not sure if it will continue.\" This is a different structure from a conditional sentence. In this case, you're using **\"if\"** not to express a condition, but to introduce indirect speech or uncertainty ‚Äî \n\nI am not sure ***of what?*** \\- if it will continue.\n\nAnd in this case, using \"will\" is correct.",
      "That is generally true. \"if\" clauses usually use the present/imperfect form of the verb. But this isn't always the case, and several verb forms can be used in \"if\" clauses. Some examples:¬†\n- if I had gone to college, I would have studied law\n- I'm not sure if I will be able to come tomorrow.\n- If I can (do something), I will.\n\n\nSometimes I've heard \"if you will\" or \"if you do\" to contrast a previous negative statement (though in this case \"if you do\" seems much more common than \"if you will\". For example:¬†\n- You said you won't help me study. But if you *will* help me, then I'll pay you back. (Again, \"if you do\" actually sounds more natural here.\n\n\nSo, you're right that if+will is not the preferred. The main exception is with sentences like the first one you wrote, \"I am not sure if it will continue\". For this, it would sound weird to me if it were \"I am not sure if it continues\". Depends on the time reference of the referred-to event, I suppose.",
      "Hmm. \"If I will go to college, you'll be at my graduation?\" It doesn't sound \"wrong\", it just sounds excessively wordy for what it is, like the \"will\" doesn't need to be there at all. \"If I go...\" covers the future/uncertain aspect of it.\n\n\"If I'll mow the lawn, you'll pull the weeds in the garden?\" does sound like something someone would say. The whole statement would be spoken like a question, with a rising tone. It's me offering a deal to the other person + asking it as a question where we share the burden and I've already offering to do the part of the deal that I want to do.\n\n\"If you will go to school, I'll take you to the movies after\" is another example like this. This would be a parent bribing their kid to get them to go to school (which is bad parenting). I don't think this sort of construction would come up between adults at work. Your boss isn't going to need to bribe you to do something. lol \n\nA coworker might say \"If you will handle calling the client, I'll write the report\". This is nearly exactly the same as \"If you handle calling the client, I'll write the report\". To me adding the extra \"will\" adds an aspect of explicitly \"asking\" the person (you) to do the if-statement thing. The plain vanilla \"if\" statement isn't asking or telling, it's just a logical statement with no sense of action to it. Like \"if the sun rises, then XYZ happens\" (just a factual statement) into \"if you will make the sun rise, then XYZ will happen\" (I'm asking you to make the sun rise).\n\n(But also you could say \"If you could/would handle calling the client, I'll write the report\" which is asking the You to do something politely without using the \"will\". \"Will\" for permissions or requests is a bit more solid or demanding.)\n\nYou probably don't need to worry about these that much, in comparison to the main if/then tense combinations. As I'm learning another language as a hobby, I keep the thought in my own mind to focus on getting the \"vibe\" of what's going on rather than memorizing tables so that's what I've tried to convey here. If I will have explained this well, then you will have gotten the vibe.",
      "You're totally right about the general rule usually, we¬†don‚Äôt¬†use \"will\" in the \"if\" clause. Your example is perfect:¬†\"If I go to the college, I will see you more often.\"¬†‚úÖ\n\nBut English loves breaking its own rules lol.

      "English has consonant sounds that end some words, **however** the way in which you pronounce them often depends on the next word.\n\n\nThe only time it is important to pronounce the last consonant clearly is when it's plural ('s') or with *can / can't* in an American accent.\n\n\n\nGenrally, don't think of consonants at the end of words as 'ending sounds', but rather linking sounds. For example:\n\n\n>*I want to talk*\n\n\nThat last /k/ sound is very weak. In my British accent, I basically don't pronounce it. However, look at this example:\n\n\n>*I want to talk about our future*\n\n\nNow the /k/ sound appears, and becomes stronger because it's followed by a vowel sound. 'Talk about' becomes¬† \"tau_kubaot\".\n\n\nIn summary, the ending consonant only becomes important if the word is plural, or for distinguishing between two similar and semantically-connected words.

But the \"un\" prefix is typically stronger than \"not\" negation.

      "It's extremely valuable. Picking up a new language is sooooooo much more than just knowing the vocab! Even if you are not actively trying to grasp every word and are enjoying the story, in the background your brain is filing away the shapes and patterns and rhythms of fluent speech. You're constantly hearing  how words are parsed or blended, passively absorbing intonation and emphasis patterns across individual sentences, but also how those patterns vary over the course of a complete conversation. You're actually passively learning how prosody works and can add layers to meaning. You might not be consciously trying to hear, but each show you enjoy is adding to your awareness of how fluent speech feels and sounds and giving you a better ear for what sounds more natural. This is exactly how toddlers pick up and eventually learn to mimic their first language(s). Picking up new vocab is only one facet of developing your English. Getting a natural feel for a language is every bit as valuable and important as understanding the words",
      "Of course it helps. It‚Äôs even better with English subtitles if you know some English. It helps a lot.",
      "It helps! But to help you with actually learning, only watching movies with subs won‚Äôt do anything‚Ä¶\nListen to music, read the lyrics, read poems, try reading it out loud, watch those reels or tiktoks in English and not your native language, if you‚Äôre confident, change your phone language to English, talk to yourself in English if you have the chance! What helps you learn, outside of studying it, is the familiarity you get with the language!",

      "For me, English subtitles helped a LOT in the beginning because I could match what I heard with the written words. But yeah, sometimes I‚Äôd just read and not listen properly. What worked better was switching to English subtitles after watching a scene first without them, then checking what I missed.\n\nNow I try no subtitles for easier shows (like cartoons or sitcoms) and English subs for harder stuff (looking at you, Sherlock Holmes dialogues ü´†). Native language subs? Rarely, ‚Äòcause then I just rely on them too much.",

      "It's hugely helpful.\n\nI've been teaching English to speakers of other languages for nearly 40 years. 20 or so years ago, young people from countries like the Netherlands, Sweden etc were streets ahead of those from other countries. We always put it down to similarity of language, the education system and the fact that native languages were not widespread. Just an interesting side note that they subtitled rather than dubbed English-language TV.\n\nAbout 5 years ago, I noticed that younger learners (teens) were beginning to arrive with really quite high-level language abilities. That's just increased. A group of 15/16 year olds from (say) South America will now have a significant number of very able English users, and the overall level is much higher. \n\nJust a coincidence that kids in countries that traditionally dubbed TV and films are now watching Netflix/Disney+ or whatever, with subtitles?\n\nMg",
      "It's very helpful to me! However, self-discipline is needed. I will really repeatedly adjust the progress bar to listen to the parts I didn't catch clearly and record the new words in the subtitles. After several times of practice, I can now watch American TV series without subtitles :D\n\nFor me, as soon as I found that I could distinguish most of the lines by repeatedly adjusting the progress bar and listening to them repeatedly, I gave up the subtitles. This is like a person in rehabilitation training just throwing away a walking stick. Yes, at the beginning, you need 1.5 hours to finish watching a 40-minute episode and frequently click \"‚Üê\" and \"‚Üí\" on your keyboard like a DJ. But soon you will get used to the speed of the lines and eventually understand the lines in one go without any stress",

That passive exposure really builds up over time. Great tips!",

As I could gather from the conversation I'd with him, his boy's feet slipped on mud or a puddle and he fell before the wheel while it was in motion. I tried to comfort my driver by saying, \"Tragedies come uninvited in our lives and from your explanation it seems nature had your son dead.\" \n\n\nSince this fatality strangely appears to be culminated through a force which we don't have a control on.

      "Your construction is understood but sounds non-standard and unnatural.  As such, it actually comes across as either old fashioned, or poetic / romantic.  It doesn't fit the tone you should use when talking to someone about the death of a family member - it sounds more like something you'd write if you were narrating the event in a dramatic poem.\n\nUnusual, non-standard language can be more powerful and evocative, because it makes us think in ways we aren't normally accustomed to.  That's why you see it a lot more in poetry, but also sometimes in dramatic prose.\n\nBut when you are comforting someone who is grieving, you're not trying to make them think in new ways - that can seem narcissistic, and just plain inappropriate.  The focus should be on the bereaved family member or friend, not on your skill with language.  Generally we would use standard, casual language in this situation.  Those left behind are dealing with emotional pain: they aren't looking to *think* about the imagery of your words.",
      "FYI, regardless of what killed the person, it is not grammatical to say \"\\_\\_ had the boy dead\" in English (at least in standard American English - maybe it would be okay in some vernaculars).\n\nIt would be grammatical, but blunt, to say \"\\_\\_ killed the boy\" or \"\\_\\_ caused the boy to die.\"",
      "I agree with the first two comments, and I would like to add that, in some places, \"to have someone dead\" means \"to make someone laugh very hard\".\n\nExample: \"My new history professor is hilarious.

However, when we speak about people dying, to use the word nature would suggest that the death wasn‚Äôt sudden or unexpected- ie ‚Äúhe died of natural causes‚Äù.",

I can recall that while saying that sentence which I've mentioned in the 1st paragraph of this post. I was struggling a bit between the words *dead* and *killed*. Would using *killed* have been better suited for this sorrowful situation and also convey without completely changing the basic idea of my line?",

      "Do questions like this actually help anyone learn English better than if they didn‚Äôt ask the question?",
      "Tiger has a long I and so does Niger. So it wouldn‚Äôt be pronounced the way you‚Äôre indicating anyway. This is because in syllabication, when you have a an open syllable as indicated by having a single G, the vowel is going to be long. Ti ger and Ni ger. Both have an I that says it‚Äôs name and is pronounced like in ice.\n\nIf you‚Äôre asking why the G is hard in tiger and soft in Niger, that I couldn‚Äôt tell you. English is just weird. Generally a G followed by an E can be soft, but when adding a suffix like ER or ED, it can also be hard.\n\nIt‚Äôs also worth pointing out that Niger is not English in etymology. Maybe it‚Äôs not pronounced with a long I where you‚Äôre from. I‚Äôm guessing those from France or pronouncing it with an E sound.",
      "If your question is why the country Niger doesn't rhyme with the word \"tiger\", it's because Niger is taken from French, which has different rules of pronunciation. \n\nIf you're wondering why \"tiger\" uses the long \"price\" vowel, while... let's be family-friendly and say that [Tigger](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tigger) uses the short \"kit\" vowel, the answer is that vowels are often affected by the number of consonants between them.",
      "Did you just want to post the N word? The logic doesn't track. Tiger isn't pronounced like Tigger, so why would Niger be pronounced that way? If they were supposed to sound the same Niger would be Ny-ger.\n\nBut to answer the question, Tiger comes from the Greek word t√≠gris, pronounced similarly. \n\nNiger's etymology is a bit more complicated so I'll just copy the Wikipedia article:\n\n>The name comes from the Niger River which flows through the west of the country. The origin of the river's name is uncertain. Alexandrian geographer Ptolemy wrote descriptions of the wadi Gir (in neighbouring modern Algeria) and the Ni-Gir 'Lower Gir' to the south, possibly referring to the Niger River.[18] The modern spelling Niger was first recorded by Berber scholar Leo Africanus in 1550,[19] possibly derived from the Tuareg phrase the (e)gƒÉrƒÉw-n-gƒÉrƒÉwƒÉn meaning 'river of rivers'.[20] There is broad consensus among linguists that it does not derive from the Latin niger 'black' as was first erroneously believed.[18] The standard pronunciation in English is /niÀêÀà í…õ…ôr/, while in some Anglophone media /Ààna…™d í…ôr/ is also used. \n\nBut for simplicity's sake, the words have different root languages. So they aren't pronounced the same despite being spelled the same. This happens constantly in English.",
      "You may be confusing Tiger with the children‚Äôs book character Tigger? Tiger rhymes with Geiger and Steiger, not with ‚Äòbigger.‚Äô Also Niger has either a soft G (to rhyme with ‚Äòobliger‚Äô) or zh depending on the speaker‚Äôs preference.",
      "TIE-gur \nnee-ZHER\n\nTiger is not pronounced the same way as the offensive word you mentioned.\n\nAnyway, Niger isn‚Äôt a word, it‚Äôs the name of a country.",

      "Because it‚Äôs a proper noun.\n\nIt‚Äôs the name of a country that was named after the Niger River, which was given its name in a language that isn‚Äôt English.

If I had to guess, The words \"led\" and \"read (past tense)\" were likely pronounced differently at the time.  \n(the great vowel shift occurred around the invention of the Gutenberg press, which is why English was being standardised at the time)\n\nWhile that accounts for most vowel inconsistencies, other oddities could possibly be related to the fact English (when written pre-Gutenberg press) was often done by scribes in monasteries who had very little contact with each other, leading to several different spellings of the same word being common.  \nThis is actually the origin of the word \"mettle\" it originally meant the same as the modern \"metal\" just being a variant spelling thanks to monastery shenanigans, but over time it changed, now meaning \"A persons ability to cope with difficulty or challenge\"\n\nwhile there are, of course, other reasons for English's goofy spelling, these two are the most prevalent ones.",

Two words enter the language from other cultures and gradually converge to have the same spelling, yet different pronunciations, as the semantic content is preserved and the written version is simplified. It‚Äôs more evidence of how English is several languages mashed together, with lots of invading loan words picked up along the way. There‚Äôs also the fact that old English used a whole different scheme for modifying words, such as changing the vowel sound inside the word.

So, to answer your question, when the first dictionary was written, the guy who wrote it decided read and read should be spelled the same, but lead should turn into led.

But \"I saw him today\" is just stating a fact in the past, no extra meaning.\n\nFor the coffee example, both work, but \"I‚Äôve had a cup\" might sound like you‚Äôre mentioning it because you‚Äôre still feeling the caffeine, lol. \"I drank\" is just neutral.\n\nYour jacket sentence is totally fine! \"Is\" works because the jacket is still black now, but \"was\" could also work if you‚Äôre focusing on the past moment (\"I bought it yesterday, and it was black\" maybe you‚Äôre telling a story?).",
      "I can't really explain the difference between past simple and past perfect, but in your sentence, you can't replace us with was unless you mean that the jacket was black and is no longer black. Also, you don't need \"and\" here.\n\nI bought a jacket that is black",

      ">  Is it okay to say \"I bought a jacket yesterday, and that is black.\"? Can 'is' be replaced to 'was'?\n\nI would say \"I bought a jacket yesterday, and it was black\".  Using \"is\" instead of \"was\" is also fine.  Using \"that\" to refer to the jacket does sound wrong, though.",

It had a beginning and an end. Maybe I saw him for a moment. Maybe we had a meeting.\n\nI had a cup of coffee - I drank 1 cup.\n\nI‚Äôve had a cup of coffee - I drank one cup up to now (maybe I‚Äôll drink more, or maybe I‚Äôll have another drink). \n\nIt gets more clear if we add the timeframe and some more details (it really depends on context):\n\nI had a cup of coffee this morning.

I think in the UK they‚Äôre more likely to use present perfect for recently completed actions, like ‚ÄúI‚Äôve just had a cup of coffee‚Äù.

      "The stress is on the second syllable (ri-STOR).\n\n\nThis means the first syllable is unstressed. If you're not sure how to pronounce an unstressed syllable in any English word, it is *usually* a /∆è/ sound (like 'the' or 'an') or a /…™/ sound (like 'bit').\n\n\nFor most English speakers, 'restore' would have the¬†/…™/ sound first, but it doesn't matter much because it's unstressed.",
      "You'll hear both, even within the same region.  Neither is any more correct",
      "For me, it depends on whether it's a verb or an adjective. There's a very slight difference, but it's there and I can hear it. \n\nRih-store - verb (We are going to rih-store the car.) It's more like a rih sound to me, same i as in the word fit.\n\nRuh-store - adjective (It's a ruh-stored car.) \n\nRee-store, only when you're talking about the Habitat for Humanity Re-store. \n\nOf course, now I'm overthinking it...",
      "I'd say *ree-STORE*, with the emphasis on the second syllable. Realistically the \"ree\" is pretty short, though. It's definitely not a schwa and it does have the \"ee\" sound, but not as long as is implied by most double-e's. Things get funky when you get to other forms, though:\n\nRestoration = *reh-sto-RAY-shun*\nRestorative = *rih-STOR-a-tiv*\n\nEtc.",
      "If I‚Äôm speaking carefully, or placing emphasis on the word: ‚Äúree-store‚Äù.\n\nIn casual use it often melds into another sound (‚Äúruh‚Äù or ‚Äúrih‚Äù) just because it takes less effort to say.",
      "In British English the first vowel would be either the ship vowel (risstore) or the schwa sound as in \"the\" or at the beginning of \"about\", which in US English is often indistinguishable from the uh sound you suggested.

Also, it‚Äôs more like the other comment, ‚Äúrih-Stor‚Äù instead of ‚Äúruh-Stor.‚Äù And neither of these tidbits matter, but this is how my brain works:\n\nReestore is mostly used with healing in video games.

The word ‚Äúask‚Äù is famously pronounced ‚Äúaks‚Äù in certain dialects, and this was more common in the past.\n\nTangentially related history: The sound ‚Äúsk‚Äù at the beginning of of a syllable was turned into ‚Äúsh.‚Äù Later, related words from other languages were borrowed back into English with the ‚Äúsk‚Äù sound still intact. This led to some pairs of words, like ‚Äúship‚Äù and ‚Äúskipper,‚Äù and ‚Äúshirt‚Äù and ‚Äúskirt, where the two words are related but now have different meanings. I say this is only tangentially related because if I‚Äôm not mistaken, this sound change at the beginning of a syllable isn‚Äôt really related to the relative lack of ‚Äúsk‚Äù appearing at the end of a syllable.\n\nAlso wanted to add ‚Äústar‚Äù is more common in computing contexts. Computer science is a relatively new science so a lot of its technical terms go against the usual scientific practice of using long words from Latin and Greek.

      "TL;DR basically never from modern speakers unless they're being ironic.\n\n\nThroughout history, English (and its older forms) has had the habit of borrowing French words to sound fancy. \"Bid adieu\" or \"I bid you adieu\" is an old phrase that leans into that in a rather pompous way. You'll pretty much only encounter it in theatre, poetry, melodramatic 1950s films, and period pieces from the Victorian Era or earlier, or as self-referential humour/irony because it sounds so pompous.\n\n\"Adieu\" is French for \"farewell\" or \"goodbye\" (it actually comes from a longer phrase that means \"I commend you to God\" - here, \"commend\" takes a rare/archaic meaning similar to \"entrust\", such as in the phrase \"Father, into thy hands I commend my spirit\" from the KJV translation of the Bible, but I digress).\n\n\"Bid\" in this context is being used with the archaic meaning \"to express [a greeting, farewell, benediction, or wish]\".\n\nSo, broken down, it would be something like \"I am saying that I wish for you to have a safe journey under the protection of God.\"\n\nNow, is this the actual meaning that a modern speaker will attribute to it? No, because its constituent parts are either archaic or a shortened phrase from another language; much of the original meaning will be completely lost on modern speakers. They'll understand it as a fancy way of saying \"goodbye\" that has an overly theatrical flair because nobody has seriously talked like that for 100 years.\n\nSide note:\n\n\"Farewell\" also has archaic origins and sounds fancy/old, though not AS fancy as \"adieu\" or as pompous as \"I bid you farewell\", and could simply be used for formal effect. Really, it's the grammatical imperative \"fare well\". \"Fare\" takes the archaic meaning \"travel\" and \"well\" is the adverb counterpart of \"good\". So \"have a good trip\" or \"get home safe(ly)\" would be more idiomatic to modern speakers, depending on context.",
      "It's not common. Some people might have their own quirky sayings like this and always say \"I bid you adieu\" or \"I bid thee farewell,\" or \"hasta la vista, baby\" but it's generally done as a lighthearted thing and it's usually like that one person you know and not everyone says it. It's not something you would say in a formal setting. I wouldn't go so far to say it's done for humor, as it's not really done for a laugh, I would call it mirthful.\n\n![gif](giphy|vwvWkWVaoWFsxFXy9y)",

Like \"you don't study hard enough.\" Or \"If you want to run a successful blog, take a leaf out of his book\" carries a suggestion of you doing something wrong that he is doing right.\n\nIt's rarely used without judgement, at least in the US (or maybe, at least in my part of the US, midwest).

If I said \"I'm going to take a page out of Frank's book and do what I want and ask for forgiveness later rather than permission ahead of time\"  I'm not exactly admitting a shortcoming.

He's been living here in the US for about 20 years now since he was 18. He speaks perfect English and has only a slight hint of an accent that you'd only notice if you were speaking to him for a while and really listening for it. But in casual conversation his accent is so faint it could almost be mistaken for remnants of a regional US accent.\n\n\nNow obviously not everyone can move to a country just to learn a language. But if you're already moving to an English speaking country, it's possible as long as you're willing to immerse yourself in the language and be patient. As in, if you go move to the UK for example and live in a community with a high proportion of people who speak your native language, that's going to hinder your progress learning English as you aren't then being forced to use English in your day to day life.",
      "The idea you‚Äôre referring to is called the [critical period hypothesis](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Critical_period_hypothesis)* in linguistics and neuroscience. Second language acquisition and bilingualism research suggests that the average is 6-8 years old, but the range for ‚Äúnative‚Äù acquisition of like language could be as wide as 5-13 depending on the individual.\n\nIt‚Äôs based on the idea of neuroplasticity (essentially that, and I‚Äôm simplifying a lot here, the brain prunes away a lot of your growing synapses to save energy as you grow into your environment, cutting away the unnecessary bits for your survival based around your childhood environment/exposure; you can of course grow back and form new connections when the environment changes into adulthood, but it‚Äôs *much* harder and growing something new is different than retaining something that would otherwise be lost). It‚Äôs *not* based on anything physical in your mouth, but more so your neural architecture.\n\nI‚Äôll drag up my old cog sci lecture notes and see if I can add any interesting papers, because I remember finding this fascinating when we discussed it in my university classes!\n\nEdit to add some more links:\n\n1.) The number of neurons you have [rapidly grows from infancy until ~age 7](https://www.psywww.com/intropsych/ch02-human-nervous-system/neurons.html), where, on average, it peaks, and your brain then begins neural pruning. This continues as [your brain matures over the course of adolescence](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC3621648/) (until you hit around 24/25), but that‚Äôs highly-variable person to person and the brain is ever-changing, so don‚Äôt let this discourage you!!!\n\n2.) [this study](https://news.mit.edu/2018/cognitive-scientists-define-critical-period-learning-language-0501) sets the first drop-off to be age 10, with the second big drop-off to be 17/18. This is one of the largest datasets testing this, which is a good sign for their statistical conclusions, but they do use an explicit grammar quiz, which‚Ä¶I dunno how well that can measure things, I‚Äôd have to get a bit more into the weeds of the Methods section before completely supporting its conclusions.\n\n3.) Puberty is thought to play a role in the shift in language learning abilities as the brain matures.\nFrom what I remember from class, the ranges of infancy~6 (neural pruning starts), 7~12 (pruning is ongoing but the larger brain changes from puberty haven‚Äôt begun), and then 13~21 (puberty has begun and the brain is rapidly maturing, language acquisition is challenging but possible), where past that it‚Äôs *hard* to learn a second language with absolutely no first-language interference, are somewhat agreed-upon, but the exact age cutoffs are murky, a bit contentious, and highly dependent on what the researcher‚Äôs testing for/what their methods are.\n\n‚Äî‚Äî\n\n*To be clear, this is the *scientific* definition of a hypothesis, meaning an idea within a field that has strong scientific backing for the moment but is subject to further change/ongoing testing as the field advances. It‚Äôs not a guess, like the colloquial meaning of ‚Äúhypothesis‚Äù. Gravity was a hypothesis before it became a theory.",
      "No, it‚Äôs not true.\n\nIt is true that learning a language as an adult means you will be more likely to retain a foreign accent than if you learn as a child. It‚Äôs also the case that adult learners usually have at least a few sounds that they absolutely cannot hear the difference between, no matter what: examples are English natives who learn Finnish being unable to hear the difference between ‚Äúa‚Äù and ‚Äúaa‚Äù, and Japanese natives who learn English being unable to hear the difference between ‚Äúr‚Äù and ‚Äúl‚Äù. But adult learners can achieve native-like pronunciation without being able to hear those differences! Japanese ESL speakers can get the R and L sounds right every time without being able to distinguish ‚Äúrake‚Äù from ‚Äúlake‚Äù when listening. I personally am learning Mandarin in my 30s and while I absolutely cannot hear a difference between ‚Äúshu‚Äù and ‚Äúxu‚Äù, I can pronounce them differently because I have studied descriptions of the tongue positions and practiced until Chinese people told me it sounded right (and yes, I know both the consonants AND vowels are different, but I can‚Äôt hear the difference between French ‚Äútout‚Äù and ‚Äútu‚Äù either).\n\nAs for age 7 being the cutoff, that is just not accurate. We don‚Äôt know at what age native-level language ability becomes unlikely, because it almost certainly varies by person and circumstances, but the actual range is definitely closer to like 13-14.\n\nAnd finally, for worldwide languages like English, there are so many native accents that an adult learner who in fact has a foreign accent can be perceived as having an accent native to some other place. Plenty of American native English speakers mistake Germans with lightly German-accented English for British native speakers.",
      "It depends on what you mean by like a native. Can you achieve fluency? Yes. Will you have an accent? Yes.\n\nI see a lot of learners get caught up over the accent. But I want you to know that it‚Äôs ok. It‚Äôs very difficult to achieve a native accent in an acquired language and the vast majority of learners never will. English is so widely spoken as a second language that as a native I expect to interact with others who have different accents than my own. \n\nEven among us native speakers there are many accents, and ultimately all that matters is that people understand you. If you work hard enough you can achieve fluency and you will be understood.",
      "This varies from person to person. It's definitely harder, and harder still if you never go live in an environment where the language is spoken, but I am a native English speaker who has lived in Spanish speaking countries and I have seen non-native speakers pass for native in both directions.  I think some people have a more natural ear and can pick up and imitate sounds better than others.  I also think even the most convincing native-like accents acquired later in life probably don't survive being very tired, or very drunk, because they always take a little bit of effort.",
      "The critical period is up to about 12",
      "Is it easy? No. But I've met several people who have done it not just after seven, but as adults.",
      "Yeah, maybe hitting perfect native-level pronunciation is harder if you start later, but I‚Äôve met people who learned English as adults and sound crazy close to native. It‚Äôs all about practice (and maybe a bit of talent lol).\n\nI started learning English at like 12, and while I still have an accent, I‚Äôve gotten way better just by mimicking native speakers in movies and recording myself. Shadowing helps a ton! Also, some accents are just harder depending on your first language like, Spanish speakers often pick up American English pronunciation faster than Japanese speakers, and that‚Äôs totally normal.",
      "Anecdotally, I know an American who moved to Italy in his early 20s. He‚Äôs now in his sixties and is so fully immersed in the language he has actually basically lost his English. It‚Äôs wild. A New Yorker born and raised who can barely string an English sentence together. His Italian however, is perfect and native level.",
      "I think you have it backwards. If you are immersed in a language at age seven, you will *definitely* speak it natively. If you are immersed later, there is a chance you won't. However, almost everyone who moves to a new country at say, age twelve (or even later, possibly through high school), will also learn to speak the language natively. I have a met a few people who were counterexamples, i.e. moved with their family at age 10-12 and didn't learn the new language natively, but they are quite rare.\n\nThere are some people who can even learn a language to a native level as an adult, if your definition of native level is being indistinguishable from other native speakers in a normal conversation. This is rare, but it is possible.",
      "definitely. i didn't really focus on my speaking skills until i was in college. took about two years to become C1. then another year and a half at work to be C2.",
      "Yes you can. It‚Äôs not true.",
      "It depends on the person. I remember being told by a teacher that it is until 12/13 years of age, but again, we are all different regarding learning so you shouldn‚Äôt really pay too much attention to that.",
      "Maybe not 7. My sister in law had no English at all when she first came to the UK at age 8. She's now \\[foreign\\] accentless & fully bilingual \\[she works as a translator\\].  \nConversely, I grew up in one town then moved to another, with a vastly different accent, at age 30, and I will never have the new town's accent.",
      "In 6th grade (age 11) my school offered 3 languages divided throughout the year (German, French, spanish). We could then choose what we took in the subsequent years. I wound up taking 2 years of French and 2 years of Spanish. 1 teacher from each put more emphasis on pronunciation and culture.\n\nAfter school, I joined the navy and toured the Mediterranean.  Often asked by my shipmates to act as interpreter and a couple times in France, have locals ask where I was from (who were then amazed when I said US).\n\nIn my opinion, \"speaking like a native\" has much less to do with when you learned the language, and much more to do with the care taken by the one teaching you."

      "From what I‚Äôve read, em dashes¬†can¬†work in formal writing, but they‚Äôre like spices best used in moderation. Overdoing it (like you said) can make sentences feel choppy or dramatic. Commas or parentheses might be smoother sometimes. Personally, I tend to save em dashes for when I really want to emphasize something or when commas would make the sentence too messy.",
      "I‚Äôm an American lawyer and I use it often (as in maybe once in ten pages) in briefs and motions to the court. I use it to connect two sentences that are closely linked.",
      "use it sparingly. it's unusual and might distract the reader if used too often.",
      "It can be useful, yes. But overuse is definitely something you will run into if you're trying to use it like that, it loses its impact if its all over the page. The best way to use it is to make something stand out, if there's a key fact that colours how the rest of the information is understood, that's an appropriate time to use an em dash.\n\nEg, criminal case says something like '...and my client admits to being at the scene of the crime ‚Äî but was provably not in the room when the crime occurred'",
      "I use em-dashes to set off an appositive phrase that merits attention (setting one off with commas can feel like the AP is less important). I would only do this once every page or so for fear of overdoing it (keeping in mind that there are more visibly obvious than, say, or semicolons",
      "Yes, it is useful, but several times in a paragraph is too much. It will be rare to have a piece of writing that would call for that many em dashes and the reader will get tired of all the interruptions. Try to limit it to once  or twice a page at most. \n\n(Like one of the other responders, I am also a US lawyer who uses em dashes quite a bit.)",
      "Yes, it's very useful and extremely versatile, often breaking up a sentence more than a comma for better flow and readability. Only problem is that AI has essentially hijacked the em dash, so I restort to using double dashes so it looks less AI-like (but this isn't proper usage--just my personal workaround)",
      "I've never used an em dash in my life. Outside of a few niche professions, they're only used when an LLM is writing something. If you use an ‚Äî then someone is going to think you used AI to write whatever it is you wrote (ok, that was actually the first time I've ever used an em dash).",
      "No, it is never used. It's only used by ai.",
      "I‚Äôd just add that it depends on the genre and subject too. It can really liven up narrative work like fiction and poetry, especially in dialogue, as well as some humanities fields where the work is subjective and self inserts/commentary are expected. In most STEM writing, they would be fairly out of place, especially in technical documents.\n\nPeople are bringing up AI, and while yes some people will immediately assume your writing is generated text when they see it, which is a shitty attitude, don‚Äôt use grammatically ‚Äúincorrect‚Äù workarounds (like using the wrong type of dash) in *formal* writing. If you must use those strategies, save them for things like workplace emails and such where the recipient won‚Äôt take the time to actually verify that it‚Äôs authentic.",

They post tips every day, and you can practice speaking too.\n\nThey also recently launched a free mobile app for speaking practice, available exclusively to their Discord community. Definitely worth checking out if you're learning.",
      "And AI has pretty much ruined its usage",
      "This should not be a concern to anybody who is in a course that takes themselves seriously. Proper use of em dashes is taught in many schools and‚Äîeven if associated with AI nowadays‚Äîcan enhance your writing and do away with excessive comma usage. If a teacher or professor actually discounts your writing as AI solely because of that then that's a problem with the institution and is easily addressed.",

      "This is mere speculation due to a lack of context, but \"left\" might be referring to political orientation in your case. Someone or something can lean politically left to varying degrees; hence descriptors like more, less, the least, the most, etc. can be applied.",
      "I would need some additional context. It's most likely referring to making a political statement that shows far-left political beliefs, but we also use \"left\" metaphorically in English sometimes to represent something unexpected and strange (like in the phrase \"it came out of left field\"), so if it doesn't make sense that it would be referring to a political statement, it's probably that.",

For this lyricist, it sounded right. If you don't have an ear for it, mimicry is your best bet. \"You're\" as \"you are\" is significantly more common and accepted.\n\ne2; and, in lieu of suddenly dissecting song lyrics, I raise the possibility that it wasn't meant to be \"you were\" at all. \"You are recommended  to me by some people\" is itself a perfectly sound sentence.  \nThe niche contraction of \"you were\" isn't used and I don't have to talk about how literally anything could be a contraction anymore.",

The use of recommended as an adjective doesn't really work though when you add \"to me by some people\" unless \"recommended to me by some people\" as a whole is doing the work of an adjective which is a little bit weird. It could also be that the singer is actually saying \"you were\" but because they're saying it fast enough it sounds like \"you're.\" A lot of online lyrics are crowdsourced and not official. I have seen lyrics for some of my favorite artists that were wrong for years online.",
      "I feel like I have to disagree with most of the comments here.\n\n\"Recommended\" can refer to a state. Someone doesn't necessarily stop being recommended just because the act of recommendation is over.\n\nIt's like \"My mother approves of my girlfriend.\" That's still true even if my mother isn't currently saying anything approving.\n\nSo, those \"some people\" might not be saying anything to Pink while the song is happening, but as long as they still think that person is someone Pink should meet, then they still recommend that person. That person \"is recommended\" by them in the present.",

      "This is such a fun example because it mirrors how people actually speak espcially comedians. Each sentence that you wrote has a slightly different nuance or even meaning depending on the stress, and perhaps head tilt and eye movement, which can be used to negate the preceding statement.\n\nShe says \\[elongate the vowel, which should be the \"e\" in \"red\"\\] she is fine \\[toss eyes, shake head, purse lips-- the degree of movement could represent the intensity of your disagreement.\\]\n\n \\[after crashing her car into a tree, but I don‚Äôt believe her\\].\n\n\n\nThere is something called historical present, which is using the present tense to represent a past event.

In option C she is fine right now.\n\nIn option A she spoke in the past, in options B and C she is currently speaking.\n\nIn option A, she was either speaking at the time of being fine, or at some other time between being fine and you reporting on her claim. For example, she could have said one of these two things:\n\n\"I am fine.\"\n\nOr\n\n\"I was fine.\"\n\nIt's ambiguous exactly which one of these she said without further clarification.\n\nTo answer your question: To report that she said \"I'm fine,\" you would use option A, and you could further clarify, \"She said at the time that she was fine,\" opposed to, \"She said after the fact that she was fine.\" This removes the ambiguity.",
      "You're right that B sounds off mixing \"says\" with past tense \"was\" feels weird unless it's a very specific situation (like if someone still says now that they were fine at some past moment, which is rare).\n\nA (\"said she was fine\") is classic reported speech you‚Äôre just reporting what someone told you earlier, no connection to now. C (\"says she is fine\") implies it‚Äôs something they still say or habitually say, like if your friend keeps insisting they‚Äôre fine even now.",

      "While I often give this kind of advice too, in this example they do have different meanings that are easily explained.

This can create real differences in how it comes across.",

I said she was a fan of Attack on Titan (because it‚Äôs the only anime I knew the English name of), and once she made a huge Titan costume and wore it to an anime expo. She used a sewing machine to make the clothes, then painted the details on it, and finally stuffed it with cotton. It was an exquisite costume, and she‚Äôs a handy person.\n\nBut after I said all that, it still wasn‚Äôt enough, so the examiner asked me to speak more. At this second I recalled another anime, Madoka Magica. I looked up the English name after the test, but during the test I didn‚Äôt know it, so I just said, ‚Äúan animation about magical girls.‚Äù I explained that in this anime, there‚Äôs a character who loses her head in a fight, so my classmate made a clay head and dressed herself in a way that looked like she was headless when she cosplayed this character.\n\nThat was my limit. I couldn‚Äôt say anything else about the topic, but it felt like only a minute had passed. I knew I was cooked, but I still had to answer the Part 3, so there was no time to be sad.\nPart 3 was also about clothes.

      "*can someone tell me what Ben Shapiro says here?\n\nIs the correct form of the quesion. \n\n(Not going to listen to Ben Shapiro, sorry).",
      "I don't have to listen to guess. \n\n\"BiBi\" is the nickname of Israeli prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu.\n\n\"Manischewitz\" is a major manufacturer of kosher food products. \n\nIt's a humorous variant on the \"hold my beer\" memetic saying, emphasizing their shared Jewishness.",
      "It‚Äôs a play on the phrase ‚Äúhold my beer,‚Äù which is a thing that a  drunk person might say just before doing something questionable. Manischewitz is a kosher food brand, and one of the things they make is wine. \n\nWhat‚Äôs very funny to me is that Shapiro seems to be implying something he does not intend by repurposing the phrase this way. Which is that Benjamin Netanyahu has acted recklessly.",
      "\"Bibi\" is an overly-familiar nickname for Benjamin Netanyahu, Prime Minister of Israel.\n\nWhen that nickname is used by someone who is *not* family/friend it is typically meant is a minor insult to throw a bit of \"shade\" or imply that the speaker wants to be a little disrespectful. He (the PM) really dislikes it when reporters or commentators use the nickname, so doing this is a way to annoy him. It's the spoken equivalent of flipping the middle finger at him.\n\n  \nThat said, this is a bit of a complicated piece to try and explain.\n\n\\- Ben Shapiro is a massive social-political podcaster/commentator in the \"right-wing\" media ecosystem in the US, he talks about and boosts culture war content and politicians who support far-right cultural views while in political office. He tends to hold a lot of \"traditional\" views and often tries to start arguments with people who disagree with him in order to generate attention for his show. Sometimes this type of commentator is called \"firebrand\"; he is right-wing, but there are plenty of leftists who do use this tactic as well.\n\n\\- The Israel-Iran conflict is a weirdly divisive topic in US right-wing politics. Shapiro is of the opinion that escalating/sustaining the conflict is stupid and, possibly, politically damaging for the party. In this clip he is insulting Netanyahu for trying to escalate to full-blown war.\n\n\\- Others in the right-wing of the party believe Israel is fated to carry out a massive, apocalyptic war with Iran and/or other governments in the region (and maybe even with all of Islam). This is more than an r/EnglishLearning thread can get into but there is plenty of reading elsewhere if you want to know more.",
      "You asked about an alternative to Ben Shapiro. If you are wanting a somewhat \"classical\" conservative or center political commentary for the US I might recommend this channel called \"The Bulwark\". They are mostly people who are socially moderate and economically conservative, and who are engaged in organizing a non-crazy wing of the center and right of American politics. They reject Trumpism, but they don't necessarily embrace the full left-liberal positions either. They are \"down the middle\" as we sometimes say. They engage in honest discussions and pursue what we call \"good faith\" discussions with people they disagree with in order to find routes by which society and the economy can converse and evolve. And often they even (intentionally) find topics among themselves to disagree on for the specific purpose of finding intellectual ways to think about the topic and formulate productive political debates. That is *not* something the far-right \"ecosystem\" does very often, or at least that the far-right does not do \"in good faith\".\n\nLink: [The Bulwark - YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/@bulwarkmedia)\n\nShapiro and many of the others (like Tucker Carlson) often inject a lot of toxic, combative, dismissive, and other untenable social aspects into their rhetoric which ultimately either require a listener to become a zealot or to reject them -- there is no in between. The clip you shared about Israel is fairly tame but he (and others in his circles) are very aggressive in demanding people either support their very intense culture-war positions that lead to a cult-like mindset, or you have to reject them entirely at some point.\n\nIf you would prefer a mix of opinions and/or center or left-of-center opinions there are those as well (there is a long list of podcasts), but from your comments and questions in this thread I think The Bulwark would be a good match for you.",
      "‚Äúand then Bibi [Benjamin Netanyahu] said, ‚ÄòHold my Manischewitz‚Äô‚Ä¶‚Äù\n\nThere‚Äôs an expression in English, ‚Äúhold my beer‚Äù, implying that the person saying it is about to do something incredibly daring and/or stupid (presumably while drunk) in order to impress someone else.\n\nManischewitz is an American brand of kosher foods (foods prepared according to traditional Jewish religious methods), which is particularly infamous for its sickly-sweet kosher wine. Shapiro is mixing it into the above expression here, since Netanyahu is Jewish.\n\nAlthough to be frank, the bigger problem is that you‚Äôre listening to this nudnik at all‚Ä¶.\n\n**EDIT:** And apparently I‚Äôve attracted the attention of a fan or two, judging by the downvotes.

You know what I am saying?\nTo be perfectly frank with you, blah, blah, blah.\nIn all honesty, blah, blah, blah.\nBlah, blah, blah, to be fair \nIn fact, blah, blah, blah.\n\nHad the conversation leading up to the question been about bathrooms in some way, perhaps the way they asked could be a segue. You use segues for minor topic changes in the middle of a paragraph or discussion. There are other uses, but most are unnecessary.\n\nBefore anyone says I misspelled Segway, please understand the use in this sentence is the two-wheeled, self-balancing scooter.

I feel like the two 'who' might be wrong together or is that my intuition is telling me that the use of the latter should've been 'whom' or even a whole new phrase makeover (?) like \"who was helping one out\" (or that could've been wrong, you guys tell meüòÖ).Either way, I'm really just relying with familiarity.\n\n  So for the second one: \"This place was supposed to be his big break\" followed by \"whose\"?‚Äîa one word reply that was enough to get me thinking really. If i were to rely again with familiarity‚Äîa simple 'who was it' or 'who\" was the only reply I was expecting to come. But the use of 'whose' perplexed me on how flexible of the usage truly is. I still don't have an idea as to why or how it was used, as well, with the \"Theodore's\" following prior? I can't also tell why there was in need of apostrophe in his name? I get that it shows 'possession' but is it a rule where the names with an apostrophe is better used?\n\nBefore it ends here, I would like to get insights whether my english is understandable or not hhehehe...",

      "1. ‚ÄòWhom‚Äô is probably correct, but ‚Äòwho‚Äô can practically always be used instead unless you‚Äôre writing a formal paper. In conversation, many if not most people just use ‚Äòwho‚Äô instead of ‚Äòwhom‚Äô ¬†in most cases.\n\n2.¬†\n- ‚ÄúWhose [break was it supposed to be]?‚Äù ‚Äî> Who was the break supposed to be for?\n- ‚Äú[Was it supposed to be] Theodore‚Äôs [break]?‚Äù ‚Äî> Was the break supposed to be for Theodore?\n\nSorry if this didn‚Äôt help, I wasn‚Äôt completely sure what you were wondering.",
      "You're over-thinking things. Don't get bogged down with \"rules\".\n\n\"Who is helping who\" is fine.\n\nPedants will say that the latter should be \"whom\", but 99.9% of people don't care.\n\nIt's extremely common to say \"Who is dating who\", \"Who is meeting who\", \"Who is driving who\", etc.\n\n\"Whose\" is a very simple, normal thing to ask, when someone has said it's \"his\" and you don't know who they're referring to.\n\nYes, the apostrophe represents possession. It was Theodore's place. It belonged to him. [That doesn't necessarily mean he *owned* it - we don't know that from the context. But he 'possessed' it in some way. He lived or worked there, or something.]\n\nYes, your English is easy to understand.",
      "For the second one, \"whose\" and the apostrophe in \"Theodore's\" are both there to show possession. \"It was supposed to be his big break\" followed by \"Whose [big break]?\" The possessive whose is referring to the \"big break\" mentioned and who it belongs to. Then the reply is \"Theodore's [big break]\". Again, it's referring to the \"big break\" that belongs to Theodore. If you were to replace \"big break\" with a more tangible thing, like a book, then the exchange may make a bit more sense since the possession is clearer. \n\nAlso, your english is pretty good! I was able to understand it all easily. One thing I'll note, though: in the second to last paragraph you say \"following prior\" and those mean two different meanings. Following means after, and prior means before. So in the way you used it, you would only need to use \"following\". \n\nI hope this helps some! I did my best to explain, but if you need any clarification, feel free to ask!",
      "\"Who was helping who\" is technically incorrect but it is such common colloquial usage you could probably get away with putting it in a college paper without losing any points.\n\nFor the second one, they're asking whose \"big break\" it was supposed to be, therefore \"whose,\" to indicate possession. Saying \"who was it\" would sound really strange, and it would be very unclear what was being asked. Saying \"who\" in this case would've been less correct than \"whose\" but at least it still would've been clear what the question was. And yeah, with the exception of \"whose,\" and \"its,\" you always need an apostrophe to show possession. To answer the question of whose big break it is, you have to indicate possession, hence the apostrophe.\n\nYour English is good! There are ordinary small mistakes (e.g. \"struck\" is the past tense of strike, and will never have an \"s\" on the end - your curiosity strikes, not strucks), but very understandable, yes.",
      "Whose is the possessive form of who, like his, her, their, its. In this example they're not asking \"who is it?\", they are asking \"whose big break\" it was. It was \"his big break\" or \"Theodore's big break\" with the subject in question being the big break, not Theodore. The reason it's not spelled as \"who's\" is because that word already exists as a contraction for \"who is\".",
      "For the ‚Äúthis place was supposed to be his big break‚Äù. the big break belongs to the ‚Äúwhomever‚Äù in this case, so we say ‚Äúwhose‚Äù as in ‚Äúwhose big break‚Äù as in ‚Äúwho does the big break belong to‚Äù and then we say ‚Äútheodor‚Äôs‚Äù as in ‚Äútheodor‚Äôs big break‚Äù as in ‚Äúthe big break belongs to theodor‚Äù \n\nFor the ‚Äúwho was helping who out‚Äù I have no idea if it should be whom I‚Äôm a native English speaker and I have never used the word whom once in my life. To me it‚Äôs like the words thou and thy. Technically they exist but no one uses them or even knows how or where to use them. ‚ÄúWho was helping who out‚Äù is a perfectly fine sentence that sounds very natural and I‚Äôve definatly used that exact sentence many times in day to day life. It is important to recognize that the second who is a different person from the first who though.\n\nAnd for your own English it‚Äôs very legible and understandable you are missing a few prepositions so it sounds a bit jumpy sometimes but a reread of a sentence every now and then is enough to understand the meaning. Your also missing a lot of plurals ‚Äútwo usages‚Äù in the first few sentences and ‚Äútwo ‚Äúwho‚Äùs‚Äù a bit later on and ‚Äústrucks‚Äù isn‚Äôt a word curiosity can ‚Äústrike‚Äù ‚Äúyou can be struck by it‚Äù or it can have ‚Äúmultiple strikes‚Äù the correct phrasing would be ‚Äúas curiosity strikes a beginner like me in this way‚Äù or ‚Äúin this field‚Äù depending on the desired meaning ‚Äúin this track‚Äù works aswell although it‚Äôs a little more clunky\n\nIt should be ‚Äúas per *the* arrows indicated above‚Äù\n\n‚ÄúAgain I‚Äôm far from an expert on every nuance in this language‚Äù\n\n‚ÄúTowards the structure of dialogues I‚Äôve been exposed to‚Äù\n\n‚ÄúMaybe I‚Äôve grown familiar with convo patterns‚Äù\n\nNot sure what the meaning is fully with the next sentence ‚Äúthat even I might be horrible at structuring an essay‚Äù this would mean that despite you being an excellent English speaker maybe one of the best a professional even. you still might suck at writing essays.

    "comments": [
      "Number agreement for [collective nouns](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Collective_noun) like \"band\" varies between different dialects of English and also sometimes varies by context. Generally, in American English the word \"band\" takes singular verbs, as do the names of bands, so American speakers would usually say both \"this band is great\" and, for example, \"Metallica is a great band\". In British English it varies more ‚Äì British speakers would usually say \"Metallica are a great band\" but whether they would say \"this band is great\" or \"this band are great\" can vary from person to person or from situation to situation.\n\nAn exception to that American and British distinction is when the band name is a plural noun with \"the\" in front; both American and British speakers would say, for example, \"The Strokes are a great band\", because that's a plural noun with \"the\" in front.",
      "American English: is\n\nBritish English: are\n\nAmerican English treats groups of people as grammatically singular, whereas in British English they are grammatically plural. This includes bands, institutions like governments/police, and sports teams. This content creator is Scottish, so \"are\" is correct in his dialect.",
      "In general group entities such as corporations, organisations, teams etc are seen as singular in the US but plural in the UK. I reckon this probably applies to bands as well",
      "Everyone being like \"American this\" and \"British that\" honestly either is fine. There is a cluster of words in English that are ambiguous as to whether they're singular or plural. Most any word for a group of people behaves this way - it's about whether you're talking about the group as a unit or about the group as multiple individuals - think of it in terms of pronouns:\n\n\n\"You're looking for the Marketing department? It's down this hall, on your left.\"\n\"You're looking for the Marketing department? They're down this hall, on your left.\"",
      "\"Is\" seems more natural to me, but \"are\" doesn't seem that weird.",
      "In British English, it‚Äôd be ‚ÄúThis band is awesome!!‚Äù, but in general, ‚ÄòBand‚Äô can use both depending on context. 2 examples are:\n\n. The band is my favourite!\n\n. The band are going on tour! (Still uses the ‚Äòs suffix if you were to abbreviate it.)",
      "I always thought both were acceptable (UK). Sometimes there can be nuance in unifying v.s. pluralising",
      "‚ÄúThe band‚Äù is singular, so ‚ÄúIs‚Äù is correct.\n\nIt depends on context though. If you say: ‚Äúthe band are all going bezerk backstage!‚Äù, you‚Äôre referring to the members of the band, so plural works. If you‚Äôre treating the group as a compound unit, then use singular. If the name itself is plural, it takes the plural form.\n\nThe Dallas Cowboys ARE a good football team. So are Tottenham Hotspurs. Arsenal is, so is Dallas. The Beatles were a pop band, so are The Strokes. Steely Dan is a band, as was Led Zeppelin.",
      "British English is more likely to use plural verb agreement with collective nouns. This applies to bands, sports teams, etc. Americans will tend to use singular forms with those unless the name of the band itself is plural like ‚ÄúThe Beatles.‚Äù Americans and Brits will both use ‚Äúthey‚Äù and plural verb agreement when referring to collective nouns using pronouns.",
      "This polish band is awesome or polish bands are awesome. Is for singular and are for plural",
      "I would say in my experience it depends mostly on context and where people are from. Like others have said, British English and American English differ the most here but I can remember cases where I‚Äôve said ‚ÄúWhen are they [the band] coming on?‚Äù Followed later by, ‚Äúthis band is great!‚Äù So it kinda depends a little on what exactly you‚Äôre saying and in what context. Basic rule of thumb would be in American English, treat it as a singular and in British English treat it as a plural.",
      "Other people have given great explanations in the comments, but I feel like, in this case, saying \"This xxxx are\" doesn't sound quite right as 'this' is singular. Without the adjective, though, it would be 100% correct.",
      "Generally, since you‚Äôre talking about one single band, you‚Äôd most likely use a singular verb. \n\nEven though ‚Äúband‚Äù refers to a group of people, when referencing only 1 single group, the subject (usually) reverts to singular, so the verb and context is (usually) singular. \n\nExamples: \n- ‚Äúthose birds are flying west.‚Äù (Multiple subjects, plural)\n- ‚Äúthat group of birds is flying west.‚Äù (One subject, singular)\n- ‚Äúthose two groups are flying west.‚Äù (Two subjects, plural)\n\n\nBut there are exceptions of course, as stated in the other threads. \n\nException examples: \n- ‚ÄúThat band is great! They are my favorite. What time do they start playing?‚Äù",
      "Whilst other commenters are correct, they're leaving out a lot of context that may be helpful to know for an English learner who doesn't just subconsciously know all the nuance of American English. Yes, in British English this would sound normal and in American English it would sound odd and unnatural, but not because you can't say \"This band are...\" In fact, there are situations where saying exactly that would add meaning to the sentence. This is because American English speakers love to treat singular, collective nouns as plurals when they're referring to the collective as a group of individuals. Thus, \"This band *is* awesome!\" but \"That band *are* the biggest assholes on the planet.\" Note how the conjugation change actually imparts meaning to the sentence‚Äîby pluralizing the verb the band becomes individuals rather than a vague entity that includes works, people, and performances. This isn't something you have to learn, but it is a subconscious practice I've noticed in myself and other native speakers.",

It might be appropriate still if the person is going on a long journey that will take days or weeks (which can still happen it's just rare). Goodbye had a similar origin but it has become accepted for general usage. Goodbye started off as \"god be with ye\" also wishing someone a safe journey.",
      "When in doubt use goodbye.\n\nBut casually speaking, English is pretty loose with terms like these(greetings, farewells, yes and no, etc) so you'll often see people borrow terms from other languages or just make up new ones. So you can pretty much use whatever word you like for it --especially amongst friends.\n\nI personally use farewell quite often but I like to be dramatic and that may not be appropriate depending on the sort of relationship you had with them. If you joked around often then go for it if you want to otherwise it may be best just to stick with a goodbye and thank you.",

      "\"Farewell, dear teacher. Thank you for imparting on me the basics of the college courses which will be used in my career.\" \n\nOn a more helpful note, farewell would be acceptable with a teacher you're close to (or the theatre teacher), but for a regular goodbye, it's is over the top.",

      "Oh yeah, that phrasing is totally correct! üëç \"Claimed the right\" sounds a bit formal/legal, but it works if you‚Äôre talking about property or something official.",
      "A synonym to ‚Äúhaving the right to‚Äù is ‚Äúbeing entitled to‚Äù. \n\n‚ÄúI have the right to eat ice cream‚Äù, ‚ÄúI‚Äôm entitled to eat ice cream‚Äù \n\nIts different than saying ‚ÄúI‚Äôm allowed to eat ice cream‚Äù because when you‚Äôre allowed to do something it means that something gave you permission, whereas having a right or being entitled means that no one needs to give you permission. It‚Äôs yours and always was and will be.",
      "It's grammatically correct, but I'd need to know the context to know if it makes sense. Oftentimes people say \"rights,\" because if you own something you possess multiple \"rights\" over it such as the rights to sell, lend, lease, remodel, demolish, etc. It is likely that \"rights\" should be used here, unless you are talking about a specific right over the house. Alternatively, if you're referring to claiming the actual proof of ownership, you might say he claimed the \"deed\" (the piece of paper that shows ownership over the house) opposed to \"right.\" It all depends on exactly what you're trying to say."

    "comments": [
      "The sound matters more than the letter ‚Äî ‚Äúunique‚Äù begins with a ‚Äúu‚Äù letter, but a ‚Äúy‚Äù sound, which is a consonant in this case. Therefore, you should put ‚Äúa‚Äù instead of ‚Äúan‚Äù. \n\nThis is the same case for words like ‚Äúeuphemism‚Äù or ‚Äúutopia‚Äù.\n\nEdit: changed vowel to letter",
      "It's actually not \"before a vowel\" but \"before a vowel *sound*\"\n\n\"Unique\" is pronounced \"yoo-neek\" so the \"an\" is reacting to the \"Y\" sound rather than the letter \"U\" (EDIT: Y is considered a vowel if it makes the \"ee\" sound, but not when it sounds like \"yes\" or \"yuck.\" Those are its consonant sound.)\n\n\"A unicorn\" but \"AN umbrella\"\n\nSimilarly, something like \"hour\" has a silent \"H\" so it's pronounced \"ow-er\" Therefore, you say \"an hour\" (because the \"an\" is reacting to the \"O\" sound)",
      "\"An\" is used before a vowel ***sound***; \"a\" is used before a consonant ***sound***.\n\n\"Unique\" is pronounced \"yooneek\", so we write \"A unique\".",
      "This is a weird one. ‚ÄúA unique‚Äù is right, because it‚Äôs based on the sound and unique starts with a consonant sound /j/. \n\nSame goes for acronyms. He‚Äôs a son of a bitch, but he‚Äôs AN SOB, because S starts with a vowel sound.",
      ">we can use \"a\" before a consonant and \"an\" before a vowel.\n\nThis is true, but it is about phonetics and not spelling. A word starting with a vowel *sound* might be spelled with a consonant at the beginning, and vice-versa. \n\n*Unique* begins with the /j/ sound, which is most often spelled as \"y\" at the beginning of a word in English. We say \"a unique ...\" just like we would say \"a year\".",
      "Use \"a\" before a consonant SOUND\n\nUse \"an\" before a vowel SOUND\n\nThe word unique is pronounced \"yoo-neek\". The first sound is a y sound, which is a consonant sound. \n\nBasically if the next word starts with opening your mouth you use an to break up the vowel sounds. Otherwise you use \"a.\n\nEdited. I had a brain fart and reversed the words I meant to use. Fixed now",
      "It's the pronunciation that matters, not the spelling. Unique starts with a phonetic consonant. \"yoonique\"",
      "Consonant and vowel letters don't directly refer to consonant or vowel sounds.\nThe article changes its form because of the following **sound**.\n\nAn hour\n\nA university \n\nAnd so on.",
      "The rule is that you use an before a vowel *sound* to prevent the vowel of the a bleeding into the vowel of the following word.\n\nDespite starting with the letter u, \"unique\" is pronounced with a consonant sound as /juÀêÀàniÀêk/ with the same consonant /j/ sound that begins words like \"yes\" or \"yellow\". Many u words start with this sound like unique, union, universe, user, all of which use \"a\".\n\nThis is unlike words like umbrella, udder, and underside which do start with a vowel sound (usually / å/) and follow \"an\".",
      "Your book is wrong. It is \"an\" before a vowel SOUND. So although \"u\" is a vowel, it doesnt always have a vowel sound. At the beginning of a word the sound is sometimes a vowel sound e.g. umbrella and uncle but it can also be a non-vowel \"yu\" sound as in university, and unique. In these cases you would use \"a\" not \"an\".",
      "Hi. As has been said, it depends on the sound the word begins with, rather than the letter it begins with. \"An\" for vowel sounds, not necessarily vowels. \n\nUnique and umbrella both begin with the same vowel but only umbrella with a vowel sound. \"A unique...\" , but, \"an umbrella\". \n\nAlso consider, horse vs  honour. Both begin with the same consonant, but you would say, \"a horse\", and, \"an honour\", since the h of honour is silent meaning the word begins with an o sound.",
      "it's \"an\" before a vowel *sound*, but \"unique\" begins with a consonant sound, \"y\". /j/.\n\n/ju:ni:k/, not /u:ni:k/",
      "Forget about spelling and think about pronunciation. This has already been said by many others.\n\nThen, use *an* in two situations:\n\n1. before a vowel (a vowel *sound*, of course)\n2. before an *h* if (a) the first syllable of the word is unstressed, **and** (b) you're middle class and old fashioned.\n\nSo, yes, you will sometimes hear *an historian* from people who pronounce the *h*, but it's rare these days.",
      "The a/a rule applies to the sound at the beginning of the second word, not simply whether or not the first letter is a vowel. The ‚Äún‚Äù in ‚Äúan‚Äù is used to separate the ‚Äúa‚Äù from the next vowel sound.\n\nBut in the case of ‚Äúunique‚Äù, the ‚Äúyoo-‚Äú sound at the beginning is more of a consonant sound than a vowel sound, so you don‚Äôt need to separate two vowels. And so ‚Äúa‚Äù, the default, works just fine.",

One of the comments I stumbled across was: \"She‚Äôs got enough baggage to fill a bus depot, but that was a president talking.\" What does that even mean? ",
    "comments": [
      "the metaphor of calling past problems (in this case scandals, controversies, etc) 'baggage' was extended in a humorous way, making the reader picture it filling not just one bus but a whole bus depot full of busses  \non the other hand the writer felt that her speech and the manner in which she gave it sounded fitting for (the positive traits one would hope for in) a president",
      "Something like ‚ÄúHillary Clinton has a history of doing very shady/immoral/problematic things, but in this situation, she spoke like a president should‚Äù",
      "Baggage- things that ‚Äúweigh you down‚Äù",
      "After reading the comments, it seems as if English grammar and vocab have more exceptions than the actual rules!",
      "\"Baggage\" in an idiomatic sense typically means something like \"issues\" or \"problems,\" so what is being said is that she has a lot of issues that would impact the country/her ability to lead, but she sounds presidential while speaking.\n\nPeople are said to \"carry their problems around with them\" or \"offload their problems on other people,\" so naturally using \"baggage\" to symbolize this makes sense.\n\nSince bus depots are places people may take literal baggage (luggage), having enough to fill one means having a lot.",
      "Thank you guys a lot for answers !",
      "Often people talk about having baggage when that have something from their past they they carry with them into the new relationship. There is a negative connotation. So it's rude to call a single parent's child \"baggage.\" If they have issues or problems due to past trauma then it can be referred to as baggage.\n\nIn general, you would not tell someone that they have baggage (it sounds rude) but someone might joke about their own baggage in a light hearted way and that is socially acceptable.",
      "Think about it.\n\nIt means she has a lot of baggage, right?\n\nThat's all.\n\nI'm sure you know that \"baggage\" can mean literal bags, or it can figurately mean concerns. Problems. Historic issues.\n\nSo, that's it.\n\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/dating_advice/comments/128a3ym/what_do_you_mean_when_you_say_emotional_baggage/",
      "In general, baggage is emotional. In the sense used here referring to a political candidate, it's more like past issues/scandals that they bring with them. So with Clinton specifically that would be things like Benghazi, her-emails, whatever.\n\n\nThe sentence: She has a lot of controversial history, but in this video she speaks and acts in an appropriately serious/presidential way.\n\n\nBy the way: it's \"Looking for help with...\", there's no such thing as \"a help\"",
      "\"Baggage\" in this sense means \"emotional problems/past issues\" and they're also using it to mean \"luggage\" as part of the metaphor. So they're saying that she has enough pieces of luggage (each full of emotional problems) to fill several busses, but that she finally had herself together emotionally and was acting how the commenter thinks a president should act.",
      "‚ÄúEmotional baggage‚Äù can also mean trauma, regret and similar emotions over something that happened in the past, but I believe in this case it‚Äôs referring to things that SHOULD cause her to feel regret, so the things she‚Äôs done that the poster views negatively",

I wouldn't say it's possessive.\n\n\"There's meaning to life.\" (Life is meaningful)\n\"There's truth to the claim.\" (The claim is truthful)\n\"There's more to the game than winning.\" (The game has more purpose than simply winning)\n\nWhat I would say is that often times it's used to apply a quality to a partial degree.\n\n\"There's some truth to the claim.\" (The claim is neither entirely false or entirely true)\n\n\nTo your second point, you could replace \"to\" with \"in\" in some circumstances, but it changes the meaning of the sentence.\n\nIf you said, \"There's meaning in life,\" what you're subtly implying is that there is something contained within life (such as a hobby or a marriage) that is meaningful, but that life itself isn't meaningful. It's kinda like the difference between having a blue can vs a regular can with something blue in it.",
      "I think it's number 4 here (\"used as a function word to indicate...possession\"). \nhttps://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/to\n\nI think this is also what's used in \"there's nothing to it\", which can mean a task has no difficulty or that a belief has no validity.",

      "Not so much possessive as locational, so yes it can be replaced with in.\n\nThe implication with to is that the truth or taste has come later (been put into it) while in assumes it's always been there to an extent.",
      "Agreed. I can't find an established term for this use. Cambridge Dictionary includes examples like these under the \"belonging\" use, meaning \"having as a characteristic feature\":\n\n- \"She has a mean side to her.\"\n- \"There is a very moral tone to this book.\"\n\n...Which I feel might be a more metaphorical extension of the other \"belonging\" usage (\"matching or belonging\"):\n\n- \"My dad gave me the keys to his car.\"\n- \"I've lost the pants to this jacket.\"\n\nI'd even say Cambridge's \"connection\" usage feels related as well:\n\n- \"There's a funny side to everything.\"\n\nI also found this thread discussing it:\n\nhttps://english.stackexchange.com/questions/393476/meaning-of-has-a-to-it\n\nPersonally I'd say this use of \"to\" frames the association between the object and the noted characteristic as slightly more loose, vague, or indirect than just saying \"X has Y\". It's like you want to emphasize that X has the quality Y without implying any particular amount or intensity of quality Y.\n\nFor instance, in your example with the cookies, \"these cookies are bitter\" or \"these cookies have some bitterness\" sounds a little more... assertive, I guess, than \"there's a bitterness to these cookies\". The latter feels like it could even just be a hint of bitterness, so I'm more so emphasizing my discernment of that quality, no matter how small. It's like I just want to loosely associate the label \"bitterness\" with the cookies, and by being more verbose (and thereby watering down) the relationship between X and Y, I am by contrast drawing more attention to my *perception* of that label. It's a very subtle difference though.\n\n(This may be just me personally, but this use of \"to\" reminds me a bit of the purposely vague and non-committal \"je ne sais quoi\", but without the positive connotation and with more specificity of what the quality is.)\n\nIt really seems like there should be a term for this specific use of \"to\" though. I would call it something like \"characteristic 'to'\" or \"associative 'to'\".",
      "Thank you! This is super helpful!! Great answer\n1. Why do you think it's a hard one in particular?\n2. It seems like the most common usage is with the structure of \"there is X to...\", right? \n3. Are there common structure beyond that one?\n4. In your last example, will it be OK to omit the last two words: ‚ÄúWow, this sauce has some kick!‚Äù",

    "text": "Have you ever been wrong in choosing between them? Have you ever been unsure about which one to use? For example, when I know the meaning of the word \"struggle,\" but I haven't looked it up in a dictionary, how do I know whether to say \"struggle in/with/whatever **doing something**\" or \"struggle **to do something**\"? (I mean the word after \"struggle\", most of comments are talking about the tense for it)\n\nHow do you native English speakers handle that? Or just remember it from daily conversations/readings?",
    "comments": [
      "I think most commenters are misunderstanding your question. You seem to be asking about the verb form that *follows* the verb \"struggle\", not the form of the verb itself. \n\nAnyway, this area of grammar is called \"verb patterns\" and it's something you mostly just have to learn.",
      "English native speakers would not have trouble deciding which verb form to use because we have grown up with the language. We know which one to use from years of exposure to it beginning from birth. We have decades of experience with English so it‚Äôs second nature to us. Most native speakers don‚Äôt even consciously think about the verb forms whatsoever. It is entirely second nature to us. \n\nThere are rules to a degree:\n\n1. Gerunds come after prepositions: We left the zoo after seeing the giraffes. \n\n2. When functioning as the subject of a sentence, we use a gerund: Running is my favorite activity. Technically you can use an infinitive, but this is not as idiomatic and is stylistic. It‚Äôs also not possible in every situation. \n\nEtc. \n\nBut knowing which form to use after certain phrases or verbs requires memorization because there is no reliable pattern to follow except for with auxiliary verbs or in certain voices (passive, causative, etc.). \n\nSo we use a gerund after verbs like: avoid, enjoy, suggest, mind, recommend, keep, etc.\n\nWe use infinitives after verbs like: agree, learn, plan, hope, promise, want, etc.\n\nSome verbs can use both without changing the meaning much: like, love, hate, begin etc. \n\nSome verbs can use both but the meaning does change. A classic example is ‚Äústop‚Äù: I stopped eating -> I was eating but I ceased this activity / I stopped to eat -> I was doing something else but ceased this activity so that I could start eating\n\nThis is also true of set phrases where some take gerunds and others take infinitives, and you unfortunately have to just memorize this.",
      "For \"struggle,\" I‚Äôve mostly heard \"struggle to do something\" (like \"I struggle to wake up early\"), but sometimes \"struggle with doing something\" works too? It‚Äôs kinda messy. What helped me was noticing patterns like verbs after \"enjoy\"¬†always¬†take -ing, but \"want\"¬†always¬†takes \"to.\" No idea why, just brute-force memorization lol.\n\nNative speakers probably just go by ear, but for us learners, I‚Äôve found reading a ton (like Reddit threads or short stories) helps it stick naturally.",
      "I see a couple of issues you could be asking about.\n\n[What preposition goes with what verb? Here's a list](https://www.thefreedictionary.com/Prepositions-with-Verbs.htm)\n\n[Whether the following verb takes the to-infinitive form or the -ing form](https://dictionary.cambridge.org/grammar/british-grammar/verb-patterns-verb-infinitive-or-verb-ing)\n\nIf you're talking about the difference between \"I struggle to go to bed on time\" and \"I am struggling to go to bed on time\" that's a verb tense thing. These both mean basically the same thing. \"I struggle to...\" is more of a general thing, there's a little space between that issue and you talking here now. The -ing ending to us specifically invokes the 'vibe' that it's something that's specifically ongoing or something you're dealing with or in the middle of currently.\n\nSo it's like \"I struggle to go to bed on time\" would make sense to say during the day or when you're not in a situation where you could be going to bed, you're talking about that in general as a pattern, whereas \"I am struggling to go to bed\" would be us chatting online late at night when you could stand up and walk to your bed and get in it at this very moment, but you aren't, you're still online doing computer things.\n\nHere's another example:\n\n* \"I have to study for school\" = it's a pattern or thing in general you have to do\n* \"I am having to study for school\" = I am currently in some sort of study plan for school, like I studied last night and I'm going to study again tonight, or I am currently at my desk studying this very moment, or something in the situation is obligating me to study",
      "‚ÄúStruggle in doing something‚Äù is wrong. Your choices are ‚Äústruggle with doing something‚Äù and ‚Äústruggle to do something.‚Äù Both are correct.\n\n‚ÄúStruggle‚Äù may not be the best example, though, because it implies a second party (the thing you struggle doing), therefore there‚Äôs preposition that goes with the gerund and it‚Äôs ‚Äúwith.‚Äù In most other cases, you wouldn‚Äôt use a preposition with the gerund.\n\nTo use other examples, there‚Äôs no difference between ‚ÄúI like to cook‚Äù and ‚ÄúI like cooking.‚Äù Or ‚ÄúI tried to talk to her‚Äù and ‚ÄúI tried talking to her.‚Äù (Notice I used past tense; ‚ÄúI try to talk to her every day‚Äù and ‚ÄúI try talking to her every day‚Äù are also interchangeable for the most part).",
      "If you‚Äôre talking about preposition usage, that‚Äôs just something you pick up.  To struggle WITH is the most common choice, as it‚Äôs a verb that basically means ‚Äúto fight‚Äù, with a connotation that you‚Äôre not doing well at winning‚Äîlike you‚Äôre kind of flailing around‚Äîso ‚ÄúI struggle with depression‚Äù or ‚ÄúHe‚Äôs struggling with mathematics‚Äù work, but other prepositions can introduce other clauses about the struggle, such as ‚Äúhe‚Äôs struggling (in school)‚Äù or ‚Äúshe struggled (through the divorce).‚Äù  And yes, you could say struggle + infinitive, such as ‚ÄúI struggle to understand her,‚Äù but if you were to take the similar verb ‚Äúto grapple,‚Äù you wouldn‚Äôt say ‚ÄúI grapple to understand her.‚Äù  It‚Äôs just something you learn.\n\nIf you‚Äôre comfortable reading English, there‚Äôs a great book by Steven Pinker (a linguist) called The Stuff of Thought that is overall about learning how we think by looking at how we use language, but is also really enlightening about how we unconsciously sort verbs into very specific categories that allow us to use each category in some ways but not others‚Äîfor instance, you can ‚Äústuff the turkey with breadcrumbs‚Äù OR ‚Äústuff breadcrumbs into the turkey,‚Äù but you can only ‚Äúfill the glass with water,‚Äù NOT ‚Äúfill water into the glass,‚Äù even though both verbs are about putting something into something else, and there‚Äôs an actual pattern to which verbs about putting A into B follow one rule and which follow the other.  It clarifies that what sounds arbitrary about English often is not, and that all languages have these ways of grouping things.  I highly recommend it.",
      "Partly we just remember, and partly it becomes intuitive. It's \"to\", btw.",
      "Normally you would say \"struggle with\" when you‚Äôre talking about something you have trouble with in general. Example...I struggle with being on time,  I struggle with sleep, I struggle with doing my homework.\n\nIf you want to use \"to,\" then it‚Äôs \"struggle to\" + the base form of the verb (infinitive).  \nEg...I am struggling to do this work. I am struggling to finish my lunch. I am struggling to stay awake.\n\nIf you want to use \"in,\" it‚Äôs usually followed by a particular subject, activity, or situation, and adds more context.  \nEg... (I love school but...) I struggle in science class. (I'm great at team sports but...) I struggle in athletics. ( I need to drink more water because...) I really struggle in this heat.\n\nWe don't really say struggle in doing (something)\n\nYou are more likely to say \"struggle with doing something\" or \"struggle to do something,\" depending on the sentence.",
      "First of all I think using \"at\" sounds more natural then \"in\".\n\nIf I said \"she will struggle to lift that box\" or \"she will struggle at lifting that box\" those are both grammatically correct and they both roughly convey the same idea.\n\nIf you said either I don't think anyone would really find it odd or comment on it and they would certainly understand you.\n\nI mulled over different verbs in my mind and I think that it generally works interchangeably. You can struggle at swimming across a river. Struggle at hitting a major league fastball. Struggle at cooking a meal.\n\nYou can also struggle to swim across a river. Struggle to hit a major league fastball. Struggle to cook a meal.\n\nI guess using \"verb+to\" seems a bit more like you're talking about this one specific time it's happening. And \"at verb+ing\" seems a bit more like you're talking about the person's abilities in general. But you can absolutely use both for both cases.",
      "In your first example, the \"in\" is superfluous. \"I struggle doing something\" is as valid as \"I struggle to do something\". Of course, \"struggle\" is also a noun, so you could equally say \"I find it a struggle to do something\".",
      "I will start by saying that there are many situations where one is correct and the other isn't. You can say 'I want to eat,' but not 'I want eating.' For these ones, you really just need to memorize the verb patterns.\n\nThat said, in the context you gave (where either is possible) there is little difference between one over the other. Generally, 'to verb' is more formal than 'verbing,' but neither is considered strikingly formal or informal.\n'I prefer to fly' is more proper than 'I prefer flying,' though both are acceptable.\n\nHowever, when the verb acts as the subject of a phrase, 'to verb' is significantly more formal. 'To read is good for the mind' is much more literary than 'reading is good for the mind.' In this situation, the latter is much more common in casual spoken English.\n\nIn all of this, I speak with personal experience with American English. Some things might not apply to other dialects, especially regarding formality.",
      "It sounds like you're asking which preposition/verb phrase to use between struggle and the next verb. Is that right?¬†\n\n\nI think these\n\n\n- struggle to [verb]\n- struggle in/at/with [verb]ing\n\n\nAre mostly the same, but from my gut:\n\n\n\"struggle to [verb]\" means the task itself is difficult to accomplish, or even start.¬†\n\n\n\"struggle in/at/with [verbing]\" is giving the *context in which someone struggles*. It's usually at the task in the gerund, but could be something else happening at the same time. It also places the struggling mid-action, so they can clearly do it at *some* level, just not well.\n\n\nThat's just my gut reaction.",
      "This is not something that native speakers ever think about. We just learn it unconsciously. But it seems to me that the second construction is much more typical.",
      "Reading the responses, no-one has mentioned a thing I've realised myself.\n\nA lot of times we write the gerund/-ing form, when we would say somethING.\n\nTry somethING\n\nTry runnING\n\nAvoid somethING\n\nAvoid beING late.\n\nYou can't struggle something. But you can struggle WITH something.\n\nTherefore I can say \"I struggle with doing something\". I struggle with socialising. I struggle with doing math.\n\nWhen using the infinitive, you need the full infinitive. I struggle to socialise. I struggle to do math.\n\nYou need to learn which verbs can be verb + something, and that \"something\" can also be an action, not just an item.\n\nYou do \"send\" something, but you can't send an action. So you send an email, but \"send emailing\" doesn't make sense.",
      "There is a very very subtle difference between \"I struggle to do this\" and \"I struggle doing this\". A lot of the time they are the same thing\n\n\\- \"I struggle to do this\" might mean \"I find it hard to do this thing *at all*\", maybe I won't even try to do it, maybe I won't begin to do it.\n\n\\- \"I struggle doing this\" might mean that you try very often, begin to do it very often, but while you are doing it, you find it very hard.\n\n  \nHere's an example:\n\n\"I struggle to get out of bed\" - to me this is what I would say if I am too tired or lazy or depressed to get out of bed. To me it means it is too difficult to even try / start to get out of bed.\n\n\"I struggle getting out of bed\" - to me this means - When I try to get out of bed, I face difficulties while I am doing it - maybe because of pain or mobility issues. I have the motivation to do it but I struggle actually doing it."

    "comments": [
      "Eh, I'd argue the meaning is less >!\"easily offended\"!< and more like someone is resentful due to an injustice or otherwise feeling aggrieved. Note that this can be due to a sense of entitlement or a perceived injustice rather than an actual slight or injustice. It can also be due to previous experience creating a prejudice or expectation of some negative future outcome. There's also usually a sense of hostility or defensiveness - as if someone is looking for reasons to be angry or like they might blow up at the slightest provocation. At least in American English. It's a bit of a complicated phrase.\n\nMore examples:\n\n* Ever since he got passed over for that promotion, he's had a chip on his shoulder. (actual injustice/slight)\n* She has a chip on her shoulder about coming from a small town. She assumes everyone looks down on her, even though they don't. (perceived slight)\n* He walks around with a chip on his shoulder, convinced he deserves VIP treatment just because of his family name. (ego/entitlement)",
      "Id add that the etymology is from literally looking for a fight.",
      "This is all correct, but probably the most concise way to describe the notion of a chip on one's shoulder is simply \"a grudge\".\n\nas far as \"easily offended\", I'd say it doesn't mean that at all.   At best it could mean the person might now be easily offended about the particular issue they have a chip on their shoulder about, but not necessarily just generally easily offended about anything.",

I would say \"will you\" or \"would you\".\n\nEDIT: Apparently there are sources, such as Cambridge Dictionary, which list \"can you\" (as well as \"won't you\") as a valid tag for imperatives: \n\nhttps://dictionary.cambridge.org/us/grammar/british-grammar/tags\n\nHowever, I stand by my original answer that this sounds odd to me and the only two options for imperatives that sound natural to my ears are \"would you\" and \"will you\". Even the negative versions \"wouldn't\" and to a lesser extent \"won't\" sound a little off to me with the imperative. IMO it doesn't really matter if a version with the tag words at the start of the sentence would be grammatically correct (which would leave multiple valid options in the OP anyway); when it comes to question tags for imperatives, only two sound natural to me.\n\nThis might be regional or maybe tags for imperatives are just falling out of use in general, since when I think about it, I'm not sure I've ever personally used them with the imperative, even with \"please\" added (as all the options in the OP sound pretty rude regardless of grammar, as others have said). It just sounds a little old-fashioned or clunky to me.",

You could also say won't you get me a drink and it means almost the same as will you but more passive aggressive. You could even say are you going to or aren't you going to. \n\nThey all ask a similar question will you do a thing or are you not going to do a thing? Since there are only two outcomes you can phrase it as a negative or positive and they mean the same thing.\n\nTechnically, \"can you\" means 'is it possible' but it is extremely common for \"can you\" to mean \"will you\". This is polite language where you are giving the person a choice to say yes or no; so \"can you\" is more like \"is this an option for you\" and \"will you\" is like \"are you going to\".

None of the other options result in grammatically and/or logically sound sentences if rearranged (except maybe \"shouldn't\" in some very specific situations that we can probably ignore).

      "Many plants reproduce sexually, so there are logically male and female plants.

      "While people are right, I think it misses some small points. Using phrasing like this is one thing that really distinguishes native speakers from just fluent speakers. It is a way of speaking that gives \"flavor\" to the phrase. In the past, \"he\" could be used here, and it just means generic \"they\" and not gendered. Using \"he\" has fallen out of style for being needlessly gendered and potentially sexist. People call things \"she\" to communicate a type of affection. It is like, \"My friendly, nice plant  is doing well and growing well.\" Like think of some endearing phrase you would give your car to imply it is your old, beloved, and trusted vehicle that you have gone through a lot together with. It is more than just personification. It creates an image of affection, like they are a dear and close friend as well."

      "\"Deceptively\" has nothing to do with size: instead it means that something is not what it seems about what follows.\n\nBut get ready for more confusion, because there is **no consensus** about whether \"deceptively simple\" means actually simple or just the opposite ‚Äî actually very complex!\n\nHere's what the American Heritage dictionary has to say:\n\nhttps://ahdictionary.com/word/search.html?q=Deceptively\n\n> **Usage Note:**¬†When¬†*deceptively*¬†is used to modify an adjective, the meaning can be unclear. Does the sentence¬†*The pool is deceptively shallow*¬†mean that the pool is shallower or deeper than it appears? Is it apparently shallow, but not really, or is it actually shallow but only looks deep? Thus, a *deceptively complex* person might be either complex or simple, depending on the point of view. The meaning of¬†*deceptively*¬†is thus very dependent upon the context, and writers should be careful to ensure that the word cannot be misinterpreted or avoid it entirely.\n\nAnother blog post on the subject: https://www.grammarunderground.com/deceptively-simple.html",
      "that's a bad definition. What dictionary are you using?¬†\n\n\nTo deceive is to mislead, lie to, or hide [something] from someone.\n\n\nDeceptive is an adjective referring to someone who does that.\n\n\nDeceptively is an adverb describing \"doing an action in a way that deceives\"\n\n\n\"deceptively small\" means \"small, but doesn't look small\"\n\n\n\"deceptively large\" means \"large, but doesn't look large\"\n\n\n\"She's deceptively kind\" means \"she doesn't seem like a kind person, but really is\"",
      "\"Deceptively\" doesn't really mean \"bigger or smaller\" or \"less or more.\" It means something like, \"Contrary to what you would assume.\"\n\nYou could say, \"The interior of the tent is deceptively large,\" meaning you expected the inside to seem smaller based on how the tent looked on the outside. You could replace \"large\" with \"small\" and it'd just mean the opposite. You could also write the sentence like this. \"Contrary to what you may assume given the apparent size of the tent from the outside, the interior is rather spacious.\" That's way more words than you need to use.\n\nI can't really think of many real-life scenarios with ambiguous uses of \"deceptively.\" You could say, \"This product is deceptively priced,\" which could either mean it's more or less expensive than you may expect. In this case, you'd look at the item, and if it looks expensive, it's probably cheap, and if it looks cheap, it's probably expensive.",
      "You will be able to understand the meaning through context.\n\n Deceptively is just a way of saying something isn't as described. So, if someone said they had a really big house, and then you find it's tiny,  it would be a deceptively small house because it's not what you were told/what you expected.",
      "I would read ‚Äòdeceptively simple‚Äô as the opposite of that. \n\n‚ÄúDon‚Äôt overthink it; it‚Äôs deceptively simple‚Äù",
      ">If someone is 'deceptively friendly' they seem nice but secretly are not nice.\n\nIs this right? My read on \"deceptively friendly\" would be almost the opposite of that. If someone is described as deceptively friendly, I'd assume that they're outwardly mean or off-putting, but they're actually pretty nice if you really get to know them or catch them at the right moment.\n\nAm I thinking of it wrong? It's possible.",

      "The noun \"Much\" is the direct object of the predicate \"is made\". The phrase is in the passive voice, so \"much is made\" but the actor is not identified. (Active voice would be something like \"People make much lately of...\") The word \"lately\" is an adverb that modifies the predicate.\n\n\"Much is made\" in this sense means \"Somebody is saying that this is important.\"\n\nThe rest from \"of\" is a prepositional phrase descriptive to tell you what they making much of.  The word \"being\" is a gerund and what follows is the complement of \"unrealized gains\".\n\nADDED: Another way to unwind this:\n\nSome people are emphatically claiming lately that unrealized gains are a means of tax avoidance, so....",
      "Here's a breakdown of the meaning of the phrases:\n\n* [**Much is made of** ](https://dictionary.cambridge.org/us/dictionary/english/make-much-of#google_vignette)\\-- a lot of importance is given to\n* [**unrealized gains**](https://www.investopedia.com/ask/answers/04/021204.asp) **--**   a potential profit that exists on paper\n* **a means of tax avoidance --** a way of not paying taxes\n\nGrammatically, the clause breaks down like this:\n\n* **Much**: subject\n* **is made of**: verb phrase\n* **lately**: adverb\n* **unrealized gains**: noun phrase\n* **being a means of tax avoidance**: gerund phrase\n\nAccording to prescriptive grammar, \"unrealized gains\" should be a [**possessive**](https://www.grammarflip.com/curriculum/possessive-use-with-gerunds/), so it should read: \"unrealized gains' being a means of tax avoidance.\"",
      "To begin with, that first part is called a clause, not a sentence. A sentence is a clause that ends with a period, not a comma, while a clause is just an idea.\n\n\nAnyway, \"much is made of\" is a derivative of making a big deal of something, meaning something is of significant attention recently or it is relevant right now, typically with a complaining connotation.\n\n\nElon Musk is saying since there is a fuss about capital gains and unrealized gains (a form of wealth) being used to avoid tax, so he will sell 10% of his stock (which will incur tax).",
      "\"Much is made of\" is a set phrase. It can be used in a variety of tenses and with a lot of adjectives, but in general it means \"there has been a lot of discussion on this topic\".",
      "A lot has been said and/or done about unrealized gains being a method of tax avoidance recently. It should really be ‚Äúmuch has been made lately of unrealized gains‚Ä¶‚Äù lots of attention has been given to this method of tax avoidance which is unrealized gains.",

      "You got straight to the whole context in just 2 sentences, wonderful",
      "Thank you! But why it will violate the sub rule?",
      "As I tell my students, one of the main reasons to use the passive voice at all is to avoid claiming or attributing responsibility (‚Äúmistakes were made‚Äù is my go-to example.) \n\nThat‚Äôs pure English leaning, not politics: one‚Äôs own conclusions may be drawn.",
      "To give more context of how the tax avoidance scheme works, what obscenely rich people do instead of cashing out their gains is get a loan against their shares.  That's how they can effectively spend the money without selling the underlying assets and incurring a tax bill.  Then when they run out of the loan money they simply get another loan to pay the first loan back and then spend that until they have to get another, and so on forever.  The rich guy winds up paying just some small loan interest rate instead of all the taxes, and that money goes to the bank instead of the government.",
      "I think technically it should be ‚Äúmuch is *being* made of‚Ä¶‚Äù¬†\n\nThat would be more correct",
      "> ‚Äúunrealized gains‚Äù should be a possessive\n\nI just wanted to add that while this might be ‚Äúproper‚Äù grammar, I think most people today would agree that it sounds unnatural in most cases. Using one of the examples from the site you linked, ‚ÄúDid your mother agree to *our having* a sleepover tonight?‚Äù sounds pretentious to me at best. I‚Äôm sure you already know this, I just wanted to point it out for OP and any other learners reading this.",
      "\"unrealized gains\" is potential profit or increased value which the person has not cashed out; it is plural, not possessive.\n\nTo \"realize\" a gain the person has to liquidate the asset.

      "Her American accent is very good. If I were just having a conversation with her I might not notice right away. But when you ask me ahead of time whether her accent sounds native, I listen in a different way. There are a few subtle tells that she's not native.  \n  \n\"develop\" the second \"e\" is pronounced like a long \"a\"  \n\"two\" sounds almost like \"tyoo\"  \n\"habit\" the \"t\" is not stopped  \n\"memorize information\" the \"z\" is not fully voiced and \"information\" is over-pronounced  \n\"routine\" sounds like \"ra-TEEN\" where most Americans say \"ROO-TEEN\" without a strong emphasis on either syllable",
      "There's a level of nasality in her speech that gives it an unnatural feeling. The accent itself is in the vowels you use and how you transition between vowel sounds and consonants. English might be the worst for this because we have tons of vowel forms (different ways to use A or E sounds etc), but 0 notation in written language to inform the reader of what they should say.\n\nRather than AN other thing, she says Uh nother thing. She also draws out some words as she annunciates them like routine or \"routiiiine\". If you want a super natural accent, try to pay attention to syllable stress when people pronounce words. stressing the wrong part of the word will make it hard for people to understand you. Imagine if say, with the word understand, you stressed DER. unDERstand. Generally you can get away without any stress in most cases, but sometimes its necessary.\n\nGet your vowels right, look for how native speakers stress words, watch some TV, and I believe anyone can arrive at a comfortable accent.

    "text": "In school, we barely had English, and because of my ADHD I missed everything possible. Now I really need writing and grammar. I understand a lot, I can say some things, but I can‚Äôt write ‚Äî I just have no idea where to start. In school we had copybooks at least, but now? How do you learn to write English from scratch as an adult?\n",
    "comments": [
      "The only way to learn is by practicing.\n\nYou say that you can't write.\n\nI think that's not true.\n\nCan you write your name in English?\n\nDo you know the alphabet? Can you write that?",
      "Did you write that post yourself? Because if so, you *can* write. Maybe not as well as you'd like to, but better than some people I've seen on reddit.",
      "I‚Äôm not a teacher but I have a few tips:\n\nFocus on fixing one thing at a time. For example, if you want to get better at using comma, google comma rules. It would give you a dozen rules and exceptions. That‚Äôs too much to learn at once. So pick one rule. Try to practice and apply it when writing. When you feel you nail it every time for about a week or two, move on to the next rule.\n\nAs for writing, what do you want to write? There‚Äôs a sub called r/writeStreakEN. You can write and post it there for corrections.\n\nFor fiction, the rules are different. Write fiction through action and you try to evoke emotion in readers. So don‚Äôt summarize, don‚Äôt explain, don‚Äôt jump to conclusions. Lay it all out and let readers decide how they should feel about it. Don‚Äôt tell readers what they should feel or what the characters feel.",
      "Practice. I recommend keeping an English diary. Write about what you do every day. You can start with simple sentences and work up to more complex sentences using this, as it's such a broad topic. Also when you have to look up a new word for your diary, write it underneath the entry with the definition.\n\nFor grammar I highly recommend Raymond Murphy's Grammar in Use series. There are three difficulty levels, have lots of great information and practice exercises with an answer key in the back so you can self study.",
      "I am experiencing the exact same thing but for me it is French, so here are some things I did, that I can recommend \n\n-If you are able to try to get your hands on old school books/ Exercise books(check flea markets or second hand stores, because new ones are usually quite pricey)\n\n- get yourself a dictionary. You memorize stuff much better when you really have to go through the entire process, compared to when you just look it up on Google translate or smth \n\n-Check online, there are a lot of resources, that might help you with that (unfortunately the ones I use are specifically for learning french, so I can't recommend them to you)\n\n\n-Just copy stuff/journal (I think someone already mentioned the journaling thing but it's a really good idea)",
      "I am an online English teacher. You can learn by writing short stories and joining an online group and publishing them. I will help you with your stories. There is no cost for any of this.",
      "For starters, I would recommend that you start by writing sentences, not very complex, but well written. Then, move on to bigger structures.¬†\n\nIf you write three good sentences, then you have a paragraph. If you write four good paragraphs, then you have a short text.\n\nMost writing in English is highly structured and it can be done by using a step by step method.¬†Just learn a couple of those structures (essay structure, short story structure, opinion piece structure, etc) and then fill them with whatever you want to write about.\n\nIt takes a bit of practice at first, but after a couple of times it starts coming automatically. Feedback is important to correct mistakes and learn from them.\n\nPS: It may sound silly, but Reddit is a great place to practice writing sentences and paragraphs.",
      "Well, my writing level is about that of a 7-year-old child, I can write very, very simple sentences, and even then with mistakes, and often I feel like I don't have enough words.",
      "Do you have any good book suggestions, to learn how to write in depth?",
      "No, this is a post written with a translator üòî",
      "Thank you for your advice! I will try it",
      "Interesting",
      "The biggest problem is confidence.\n\nIf you say \"I cannot write\", then you won't learn to write.\n\nYou must try.\n\nYou will make a lot of mistakes. That's fine. That's how you will learn.\n\nSo... write something. Here.\n\nWrite 500 words about cheese. Or aliens, or cats, or England, or art, or walking, or football, or elephants.",
      "You post and this comment are a higher level than most 7-year-olds can do. Cut yourself some slack, you‚Äôre already on your way. \n\nBut yes, practice is really the only way to improve.",

This sounds to me more like someone else doesn't want you to go, and I agree with that person that I don't want you to go.",
      "They are both wrong.\n\nI'm not sure what you are trying to say.\n\n\"I don't want you to go\" is OK.\n\nIf someone else (person A) has said that, then you could say \"I don't want you to go either.\" That means you feel the same as person A.\n\nNone of this gives the *reason* why you do not want them to go.\n\nYou would need to say that in a different way.

      "*To lease* is essentially another term for *to rent *. A leasing place is either a car dealership or an office for renting an apartment. An important distinction is when talking about cars, leasing and renting mean different things. You'd rent a car when you just need a car for a few days or whatever. Imagine you're on vacation and need a car for your stay. When you lease a car, you have the car for a few years before you have to return it. You'd do that when you need a car for everyday life, but don't want to purchase a car outright.",

You pay a certain amount of money to use the item, for a fixed length of time.\n\nLike a hire car. But long term.\n\nSome people prefer to lease a car for a few years, rather than buying one. It can be cheaper, and it spreads out the payments. But at the end of the two years (or whatever), you give it back. You never own it.\n\nThere's also a thing called \"lease-purchase\" (or various other names), where you may have an option to pay more so that you eventually own it outright.\n\nOther things can be leased, e.g. machinery, furniture, etc."

      "You may hear (likely older) people say he/she (pronounced as \"he slash she\" even), but that's pretty outdated use at this point. Many people who insist it must be \"he/she\" instead of \"they\" do so out of stubbornness against folks who prefer to go by \"they\" rather than a gendered pronoun.",
      "'they' is also used for a single person of unspecified gender, using the same conjugations as though it were plural; 'they are' not 'they is' (though you may hear 'they is' occasionally, in certain dialects of english.)\n\nAlso, in extremely formal speech (like, laws, contracts, butler characters on TV, stuff like that), 'one' might be used as well. i.e. 'if one were to fall off a building, would one survive?' In this way, 'one' conjugates the same way as 'he' and 'she'; 'one is' not 'one are'.",
      "‚ÄúThey‚Äù is used when you don‚Äôt know or when you are talking about more than one person.",
      "Use ‚Äúthey‚Äù. He and she are gendered (masculine and feminine), and ‚Äúit‚Äù is only used for things like inanimate objects rather than people. So ‚Äúthey‚Äù is the correct choice",
      "In addition to singular \"they,\" English also has the indefinite pronoun \"one\" which you may use in place of \"a person\" in such cases. E.g., your second example could be written \"if one falls off a building...\"",
      "Many people default to whichever gender they are themselves, I call anybody \"he\" in a hypothetical where the gender is unspecified, but in cases where I just can't really tell for certain what their gender is, then I say \"they\"",
      "always use they if you don‚Äôt know the gender.",
      "*They* is the simplest answer. Before singular *they* became acceptable in formal English, but after epicene *he* became controversial, we had to avoid using pronouns or change the nouns to grammatical plurals.",
      "They",
      "Singular they is always correct where referring to an indefinite (\"generic\"/nonspecific/unknown) person, as in the examples you give. \n\nYou will sometimes see or hear people just pick either 'he' or 'she' and that's understood just fine, but it tends to reinforce unfortunate gender stereotypes (such as defaulting to \"he\" for any surgeon and \"she\" for any nurse) so it's better to avoid that unless the context makes the sex or gender of the person you're referring to relevant.  For example, if you're discussing patient care standards after a vasectomy, it's reasonable to refer to the generic patient as \"he\".\n\nSingular they can also be used, but is not always the best choice, if you're referring to a specific individual, but you don't happen to know their gender.  Again, context is important.  If this person is someone you will have an ongoing relationship with, ask their pronouns and refer to them accordingly.  But if you mean the total stranger who just drove past you, and for whatever reason you want it to be immediately clear that you mean the driver only, not everyone who was in the car, it's fine to take your best guess based on the person's appearance and say something like \"did you see his hat?\"  It hurts no one if your guess happened to be incorrect."

You could offer (with her permission) to use English as your primary language together. But: No teaching, no correcting mistakes, only positive reinforcement and patience! Give her a few phrases she can say \"How do you say ----?\" \"Repeat?\", write them down on notecard, even better if she writes the phonetic spelling below it, however it sounds phonetically to her.

During those times, practice the stuff she's learning from her teacher, watch English language media together and talk about them (kids shows or kids learning channels, maybe), and once she knows enough English that she can make simple sentences, play games or do activities together where you both speak as much English as possible, even if for week one that's only you telling her the words for stuff. Repeating similar activities, like a favorite game or daily chores, will really help because the same words will keep coming up.¬†\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAs far as motivation goes, when you hear her doing things well, tell her.

Example, I got this one wrong:\n\nAntidote to\n\nIn Dutch that would be tegengif, and you would say tegengif voor (for) or perhaps tegengif tegen (against), but definitely not tegengif tot (closest translation to 'to' in Dutch).\n\nAny idea?

Like, \"solution to,\" \"answer to,\" and \"antidote to\" all follow the same pattern. Maybe try making flashcards with the whole phrase instead of just the preposition?\n\nAs for exercises, I‚Äôve used this site before:¬†[EnglishPage.com Prepositions](https://www.englishpage.com/prepositions/prepositions.html).

'Against' could work, but it feels like you're taking a little too much poetic license. 'To' is just plain wrong and sounds non-native to me.\n\nFlipping the script, it would be... just barely acceptable to say \"antivenin doesn't work as an antidote to snake venom.\" 'Against' would be fine here, but 'for' is again my preference.\n\nThe only time (that I can think of offhand) where 'to' is preferred is in situations like, \"deliver this antidote to the man in black.\"",

I like the suggestion from the other commenter here about flash cards with word strings instead of working with each standalone element, but assure you that you're on a great path- and as best I can tell, seem to think in conversational English, not stuffy collegiate thesis English, haha.\n\nAs an aside, in your last paragraph, consider shifting 'probably' to the right, as in '...so there is probably only one...' for AmE.

      "From what I can tell, this is a general midwest ish accent. Theres no signs of any southern, western, northern or eastern influences. In the Midwest, there's a lot of mobility to and from the major cities so generally, specific accents just dont have time to form. The same applies to other major metro areas with some big exceptions.\n\n\nIts considered standard American English, but I'd only describe it as such as a measure of how common it is. There are a LOT of accents throughout the US and Canada. If you're interested in more accents, here's some you can look for on YouTube or otherwise:\n\n\nBoston (City in Massachusetts) Accent\n\nMinnesota Accent\n\nBrooklyn (part of New York City) Accent\nBaltimore Accent\n\nRez (nativw reservation) accent¬†",

      "Writing can be so frustrating sometimes, especially when other skills feel stronger. üòÖ I‚Äôve been trying to improve mine too, and one thing that‚Äôs helped me is keeping a small notebook (or even just a notes app) for phrases/expressions I¬†encounter on a daily basis like from books, shows, or even Reddit posts. Then I try to use them in my own sentences later.\n\nAlso, maybe try writing short paragraphs (even just 2-3 sentences) about your day or random thoughts? It‚Äôs less pressure than long essays, and you can focus on making those few sentences as clear/natural as possible.",
      "Hey! üëãüèª It‚Äôs great that you‚Äôre already reading, writing, and learning vocab ‚Äî that‚Äôs a solid start. Here are some things that might help you further:\n\n\n1) Find short, high-quality paragraphs (from Cambridge sample essays, blogs, or articles) and try to imitate the structure. This helps you absorb how strong writing feels ‚Äî like sentence flow, connectors, and tone.\n\n\n2) Take one paragraph you wrote and spend 15 minutes improving it. Replace weak words (like ‚Äúbad‚Äù or ‚Äúthing‚Äù), fix sentence order, and connect your ideas better. The better you get at recognizing weak spots, the faster you‚Äôll be able to do that while writing.\n\n\n3) Instead of memorizing single words, collect useful expressions like:\n\n\n‚ÄúIn contrast to‚Ä¶‚Äù\n‚ÄúOne major issue is‚Ä¶‚Äù\n‚ÄúThis suggests that‚Ä¶‚Äù\n\n\nThen build 1‚Äì2 sentences using each one. You‚Äôll retain vocabulary much better when you put the words into practice.\n\n\n4) Find a tutor to check your writing, post it on Reddit, or even paste it into ChatGPT and ask:\n\"Does this sound natural? How can I improve this paragraph?\"\n\n\n5) Speak your ideas aloud, then turn them into proper paragraphs. It helps you write more fluently and naturally. (This one worked best for me when I was starting and preparing for my Cambridge exam.)\n\n\nHope some of this helps you! üòä",
      "I‚Äôd recommend a journal or diary and a dictionary (online or physical). \nIt‚Äôs a good way to get the words you use most and practice using them in sentences.\n\nAnother good way to learn is reading some English writing and paying attention to words and grammar you don‚Äôt know/understand. News articles, books, whatever it is you find interesting should work. (Except maybe social media because grammar and spelling can be a bit iffy in less formal settings. It‚Äôs not bad for learning informal speech though.)",

And any other devices - laptop, smart TV.\n\nAttached post-it notes to everything in your house. Toothpaste, kettle, banana.\n\n(Not cat. It doesn't stick. And not wife, because they seem to object.)\n\nRead. Always have a book, and read a little bit any time you have five minutes. Waiting for a bus, in a long queue, etc.\n\nListen to BBC Radio 4 (or World Service). Have it on in the background while you're doing other things - cooking, cleaning, whatever; you don't need to be paying attention to it, just have it in the background.\n\nI know a lot of those tips aren't directly related to writing, but.. they help.",

So \"The horse (that was) walked past the barn (subsequently) fell down.\"\n\nIn speech, there isn't as much ambiguity because you would pause between \"horse\" and \"walked.\" In writing, you can technically avoid setting off the phrase with commas (from a style guide perspective at least) but I would never personally do it. Always \"The horse, walked past the barn, fell down.\"",

All other pans have shallow sides and long handles, whereas all other pots have high sides and short handles.\n\nSo to recap: A saucepan is not a pan, it is a pot. Yes this is annoying.",
      "In the UK at least this seems to be individual preference, though pan seems to have become a lot commoner over time.\n\nIn the 1980s, I grew up calling both these types of object pots. However as I got older, I found that a lot of people called them pans, especially ones with handles, and over time I started saying that more frequently so I could be sure they knew what I was talking about. But I still prefer to say say pot for any relatively deep ones such as those in the picture, while pan would refer to a flat shallow one a.k.a. frying pan\n\nIt's also possible that there is some regional difference, although I've not spotted one consistently despite having lived in a lot of different parts of the UK. I'd be really interested to hear if other British people, especially middle-aged or older, have observed regional variations.",

Many American households will have saut√©/saucier pans, braisers/braising pans, or roasting pans in the kitchen as well.\n\nDespite the name, most Americans would consider saucepans to be a pot‚Äîthe inverse of a pan, where the sides are tall relative to the base. The archetypical pot is a saucepan (like the orange item in your first example) or a stock pot; dutch ovens (the blue item in your second example) are also common.",

      "I suppose they're both pots, really, but in the UK a lot of people would disagree, including me. My understanding was always that anything with a long handle is a pan, anything else is a pot, but some would call both pans! It's such vague and largely interchangeable terminology in UK English that I wouldn't worry about the difference.\n\nIf for a specific reason you need to avoid confusion it's best to specify the type of pan/pot. Orange is a saucepan, blue is a casserole dish.\n\nAmerican posters are likely to refer to blue as a \"Dutch Oven\" - DO NOT USE THIS IN THE UK. We don't call anything to do with cooking this, instead in UK English it means a space where someone has been farting a lot!",

      "I have developed a very elite technique for this over many years. It goes like this:\n\nYou walk up to a person, say, \"Hi, my name's <insert name here>. What's yours?\" In business settings, as you do this, extend your right hand and give them a firm, brief, (and most importantly) dry handshake.\n\nAnd that's it. 100% success rate. The handshake can be used in some casual settings as well, but there's some nuance to that. Hope this helps.",

Every human being has their own desires, and It seems to me that our desires are shaped by our ideals. Furthermore, it is plausible to say that we feel happiness when our actual reality appears to reach our ideal.\n\nLet me now define a Utopia as the place where we can experience positive events constantly so that we can feel continuous happiness. According to the definition of a Utopia, the Utopian system must operate in a certain way that fulfills a human being‚Äôs happiness. To do so, the system would need to track an individual‚Äôs desires and trigger events to change the environment positively at appropriate moments for the individual, which is apparently acceptable. However, thinking of a Utopia, there are lots of people who hold different ideals. It means, at least, each group of people in the same place has a different desire at the same moment. Therefore, the system must operate distinct ways that fulfill each human being‚Äôs happiness, simultaneously. This is impossible because such an environment can‚Äôt be changed in distinct ways at the same time. All events are interconnected and affect each other even in a Utopia.",

      "You‚Äôre being very wordy in your writing and repeating things multiple times. This can be rewritten much, much more concisely. Here‚Äôs an example where your entire piece can be condensed into just three or so sentences: \n\nIf a utopia is a place where all people experience continuous happiness, then a utopian society must in turn function in a way that fulfills each person‚Äôs ideals; however, each person‚Äôs ideals will differ, sometimes a little and sometimes a lot. This requires a utopian society to operate in a way that must inherently contradict itself at least sometimes. For this reason, a true utopia is not possible.\n\nMy tip for you as you rewrite would be to focus on brevity and remove the unnecessary repetition or deepen your argument so that there is more substance (if you‚Äôre doing this for an assignment and need to have a certain length).

You could recast it as \"~~There is not one good reason why utopias could exist~~\" \"There aren't any good reasons why utopias can exist\" Then you go on to list all the reasons you think aren't any good.\n\nOverall, I would define the utopia first, and then say \"But every human being has their own desires...\" and then the conclusion \"Therefore, the systems that operate....\"\n\nI don't know that this is a problem of English and grammar, as much as it is about formulating an argument in a logical order.",

      "Your writing is really wordy. You are using complicated language in circles without getting to the point. This makes your writing hard to parse. \n\nYour first paragraph could easily be ‚ÄúUtopias can‚Äôt exist because every human has their own desires and ideals. Humans are happy when their desires and ideals are fulfilled.‚Äù Even then it makes no sense because you don‚Äôt actually explain your initial premise. You just say they can‚Äôt exist and list other claims. \n\nAnother issue is that you constantly restate the context of everything. ‚ÄúLet me define a utopia‚Äù ‚Äúthe definition of a utopia‚Äù, ‚Äúa utopian system‚Äù, ‚Äúthinking of a utopia‚Äù, ‚Äúin a utopia‚Äù you also restated the definition and requirements of a utopia like three times.

Achieving this would require continuous monitoring and changing the world to fit your unique happiness. However since everyone has different desires and ideals, it‚Äôs impossible for a utopian system to make everyone in one place happy at the exact same time.‚Äù\n\nBeyond this, depending on the objective of the class or the reason for this argument I would possibly dock some points for your misunderstanding of what a utopia is. You‚Äôre writing about a really narrow concept of a utopia that you made up rather than consulting a dictionary or looking up examples.

It functions like a noun, and yes, it could be used in speaking as you describe, often in a similar way to your written example, where a speaker is setting up a subject for discussion that they will then discuss further. It sounds a bit formal, but it's not strange to hear it among friends when one is explaining something to another. \n\n\nThis sort of pattern, a noun... apause... and an explanation  is often used with a specific falling intonation in presentations, or explanations of processes or systems to indicate that more info is coming. \n\nFor example, a host at a boardgame party might say this as they they are placing a new board game on the table. \n\nOkay... so... how this works....   we all roll a dice and move around the board, and... blah blah blah. \n\nIt's often described in grammatical terms as a subject in apposition, where you state the same noun twice without a conjunction for a \"double\" subject.

The lobster, what we're eating first, is almost ready!  \n\n\nYou can expand that second subject out to extreme lengths in speaking.  \n\n\nA history teacher might say to a class... \n\n\nAlright, everyone sit down. Let's get started. Who we are studying today... the Mongols, a horse tribe from the eastern steppe.  They rose to power a thousand years ago.

So... where they stopped...  eastern Europe and the northern Chinese border.  \n \nThe pattern is being used to introduce new topics that require explanation.\n\nTLDR: we use this pattern with pretty extreme falling intonation to set a subject for discussion, provide more detail about a subject, or clarify why a subject is important.",

    "comments": [
      "After you set the thermostat to 24 degrees, we say it is set at 24 degrees. ‚ÄúTo‚Äù tells you where it‚Äôs going, while ‚Äúat‚Äù tells you where it is now. You don‚Äôt normally set a thermostat ‚Äúfor‚Äù anything but you‚Äôll be understood. \n\nYou don‚Äôt set a timer ‚Äúat‚Äù a time because ‚Äúat‚Äù implies a specific time, not a length of time. ‚ÄúFor‚Äù tells us the length of time. ‚ÄúTo‚Äù tells us a new setting. So. *At* 9:30 I set a timer *for* ten minutes. Then someone told me ten minutes wasn‚Äôt long enough, so I reset it *to* twenty minutes. Does that make sense?",
      "For the thermostat, I would say \"to\" or \"at\". For the timer, I would say \"for\".",
      "For thermostat, I‚Äôd say either to or at. For timer I‚Äôd say either to or for.¬†",
      "\"To\" would be my usage for the thermostat.  \"At\" would be perfectly understandable, but it's not something I would personally say.  \"For\" is the only preposition I would use for the timer.",
      "I would use ‚Äúto‚Äù in the first example and ‚Äúfor‚Äù in the second example (although I would not find ‚Äúto‚Äù unusual there).",
      "Generally, units of time or distance use 'for':  \nI set a timer for 20 minutes. We drove for 300 miles. I worked out for 30 minutes. I haven't seen him for two weeks. We're going away for a few days.\n\nMost other measurements use \"to\" or \"at\". These are largely interchangeable, though \"at\" is generally used in the past tense:  \nOur spending limit was set at ¬£30. The bar was set at 5 meters.  \nWe're limited to 50mph in this vehicle. Set phasers to stun (not a great example this last one, but in this context 'stun' is a setting on a scale, so it is kind of a measurement).\n\nAnd sometimes, you need both in the same sentence:  \nBake in the oven *for* 30 minutes *at* 180 degrees.\n\nEdit: Just an edit to say there are specific circumstances where you would use \"at\" for a length of time, which is again if you're describing a thing that has (or had) a limit: \"The record was previously set at 1hr 45m for this race distance\", \"the time limit for this task is set at 3hrs\". In these cases, you're talking about the record or the time limit, not the actual time itself. I'm not sure how best to describe this one, other than to say every rule has exceptions. :D\n\nThere's also an example I can think of where you'd use 'to' for a period of time: \"Reset the clock to 1m 30s\".",
      "Here is how I would interpret each of them:\n\n.\n\nThermostat:\n\nTo: You adjusted the thermostat so it is now at 24 degrees (C). Standard usage.\n\nFor: You adjusted the thermostat so it is now at 24 degrees (C). Not really standard; the emphasis here is on the fact that the temperature in the house will become (or is *expected to become*) 24 degrees at some point in the near-ish future, and most likely is not 24 degrees right now.\n\nAt: When the temperature in the house (or other area with its temperature being recorded) reached 24 degrees, you set the thermostat to a temperature that might have been mentioned earlier.\n\n.\n\nTimer:\n\nTo: You set the timer such that it now reads 10 minutes. You did not necessarily start it or stop it.\n\nFor: You set the timer such that it will go off 10 minutes from now.\n\nAt: When ten minutes had passed since some event (likely mentioned previously), you set the timer to some amount (likely also mentioned previously).\n\n.\n\nTLDR: Thermostat *to*, Timer *to* or *for* depending on context.",
      "‚Äú‚Ä¶ at 24 degrees‚Äù\n‚Äú‚Ä¶ for 10 minutes‚Äù\n\nAn *alarm* would be set *for* a certain time, but a timer is set *for* a length of time.\n\nBut in most other cases, ‚Äúset‚Äù is followed by ‚Äúto‚Äù (or ‚Äúon,‚Äù if you mean ‚Äúset‚Äù in the sense of ‚Äúplaced.‚Äù). So you may hear ‚Äúset to 24 degrees‚Äù or ‚Äúset to 10 minutes,‚Äù and most likely no one would notice if you said either.",
      "Casually all of these are acceptable and I've heard every one of them used without even blinking at it.\n\nVery very slight differences in connotation, but I'd have a hard time explaining them all.",
      "\"I set the thermostat to 24\"\n\"The thermostat is set at 24\"\nI wouldn't use \"for\"\n\n\"I set the timer to 10 minutes\"\n\"I set the timer for 10 minutes\"\n\"The timer is set at 10 minutes\"",
      "To\n\nFor",
      "If we are going with the most technically correct answer it would be that you set the thermostat to 24 degrees and set the timer for 10 minutes. \n\nYou might hear these differently in day to day speech depending on the region. For example if it was a dial timer I might say that I set the timer to 10 minutes because I physically moved the dial to the 10 minute mark",
      "First one is both honestly but to is more common, second one depends on the specific context of the quote because I can make a scenario where all three work",
      "...at 24 degrees Cesius\n\n...for 10 minutes.\n\nI do think \"set to\" would also be okay in normal conversation but strictly speaking \"at\" is used when listing a precise value and \"for\" is typical for a time period vs \"to\" is more common with like a physical position (e.g. on/off, angle degrees, etc). But since historically, both of these used to be physical, analogue devices that had marked positions for the value you wanted, \"to\" does work here.",

You also seemed to switch between rhotic and non-rhotic speech. You pronounced ‚Äúare‚Äù like ‚Äúah,‚Äù which is fine, but then you pronounced ‚Äúor‚Äù with the ‚Äúr.‚Äù You just need to be consistent.

      "Good pronunciation overall!\n\nOn \"ultra\", make sure you make the initial \"uhll\" sound clearly.

That would help the listener really hear where each word ends and begins. \n\nGreat job though, and best of luck improving!",
      "Your 'er' sounds and 'ah' sounds are over emphasised , a lot of this might have to do with morphemes in words. For example, in the word government, there is a free morpheme and a bound morpheme. \n\nGovern (free - its own word)\nMent (bound - it's a suffix) \n\nSo instead of pronouncing it in a syllabic way (eg, GOV Ern ment), try pronouncing it with the morphemes in mind (govern - ment)",

My suggestion for improving pronunciation long term would be to form a playlist of like 50-100 songs and listen to them on repeat until you know them by heart.

It's not easy to feel a wide arrangement of emotions, to be friendly, to carry burdens, to keep going, to be stressed, sad or exhausted. You wouldn't want to be a cat either if you're still human, because that would mean that despite being a cat, you would still have human emotions and worries.\n\n\nThat's more a philosophical approach, though.

I've been reading to my son since he was 3 months old. \n\nThat said, my son was *really* into dinosaurs and could read and remember tons of dinosaur names by the time he was 4. So it's not necessarily that weird for a little kid to know big words for something they're really interested in. And even if they can't read the letters, they may know the name of the dinosaur and be able to recognize it.",

The words are a bonus for older kids and maybe even adults.",
      "The vast majority of 2yos can't read at all, so this little girl probably wasn't reading the words. I could believe that she'd memorised them though, assuming her dad had been reading the names for her and she has connected them to the shapes. At that age, my niece didn't know dinosaur names but she knew some other words you might not have expected her to, just because that's what she was interested in. \n\nI know how to spell the names of the dinosaurs I hear about most often - velociraptor, tyrannosaurus rex, triceratops, pterodactyl, etc. - but probably couldn't even name a lot of the less common ones. I never had dinosaurs as a special interest when I was a kid the way a lot of kids seem to now."

    "text": "Guys, I'm currently learning English and I can't understand the difference between discouraging and disheartening. Plssss help ü•≤\nThank you all!!! ",
    "comments": [
      "Here‚Äôs how I see it:\n\n* **Discouraging**¬†is when something makes you lose motivation or confidence to keep trying. Like if you fail a test and it makes you wanna give up, that‚Äôs discouraging.\n* **Disheartening**¬†is more about feeling sad or hopeless because of something. Like if you put a lot of effort into a project and it still fails, it‚Äôs not just discouraging (making you not wanna try again), but also¬†disheartening¬†(makes you feel really down).\n\nA little trick: think of \"disheartening\" as hitting your¬†heart¬†(emotions), while \"discouraging\" hits your¬†will to keep going.",
      "They're pretty much synonyms; discourage is a little more flexible in its use, for example one use is \"to try to dissuade/prevent something,\" whereas dishearten is used mainly only one way. Examples on Merriam-Webster: [discourage](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/discourage) and [dishearten](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/dishearten).",
      "Both come from the same root word. The cour- comes from *cor* meaning \"heart\" in Latin.¬†\n\n\nDiscouraging refers to something that is probably going to turn out poorly, but hasn't yet.¬†\n\n\n*With a discouraging score of 5-0, the team started doubting their prospects.*\n\n\nDisheartening refers to something that has turned out poorly.\n\n\n*The locker room was silent as the team grieved their disheartening loss.*",
      "They have slightly different connotations but they're pretty much entirely interchangeable. I can't think of a single example where it is appropriate to use one but not the other.\n\nTo take (or have) heart basically means to have courage.",
      "Disheartening rarely gets used. Both words share essentially the same meaning, but disheartening might feel a little deeper. Something discouraging feels to me like something temporary. Something that is disheartening feels more heartfelt and thorough.",
      "Feeling Disheartened is to lack motivation because things aren‚Äôt going to plan or something bad/sad has happened. \n\nDiscourage is more like trying to persuade someone not to do something (the opposite of encouraging), although you can also feel discouraged, which could, I suppose be similar to disheartened.",
      "Part of language is interpretation, so here would be my mine:\n\nDiscouraging - root = lack of courage, bravery. Used when something sets you back or hinders working toward a goal. For example: it is discouraging to see that I haven‚Äôt made any progress in my book report.\n\nDisheartening - root = lack of/losing heart. Being disheartened feels much more like a‚Ä¶ feeling, if that makes sense. For example: it disheartening to see that most children are addicted to social media.",

It‚Äôs an extra resource just for Discord members, which is pretty cool.",
      "I don‚Äôt fully disagree about connotations here, but if you switched discouraged and disheartened in these two example sentences, both sentences would still be fully correct and sound natural. Despite slight connotation differences, these words are largely interchangeable, with the one caveat that peekandlumpkin points out below.",

    "title": "The usage of the verb \"spam\"",
    "text": "Hello. I'm learning English and became curious about the correct use of the verb 'spam.' It seems like a slang term for sending spam emails (literally) or pressing buttons many times quickly.\n\nHowever, can it also mean to 'place/build something all around'? For example, can I say, \"You don't want to spam parking lots all around the city unless you want to create an urban hell?\"",
    "comments": [
      "Both usages are come ultimately from a Monty Python sketch. Spam is a processed meat product, and in the sketch, someone goes into a cafe and discovers it \\~only\\~ serves Spam, in various preparations. The sketch ends with them singing a song, the only word of which is \"spam\".\n\nMonty Python was extremely popular with nerds, and nerds were the people deciding what to call a lot of computer terms, which have since become incredibly important to culture more widely. Spam email sends everyone the same thing, much like the cafe will serve everyone spam. \n\nSpam email is so prevelent, and the term for it so widely known, that \"spam\" become a common term for when something's the first and last thought. So in your example, you've got some urban space? Just put down a parking lot. No need to think more about it, parking lots are cheap and make money. You are serving everyone the same thing.",
      "Technically, your second example is okay and understandable. \n\nGenerally, I (I'm not going to include all native speakers) use spam with digital things such as messages, ads, and links. And sometimes this can go into the physical world, such as \"spam the city with billboards,\" or \"spam your desktop with shortcuts\", or \"They‚Äôve spammed the city with neon signs\". However, in the physical aspect, it is more related to advertising.",
      "Yeah, \"spam\" is mostly used for sending unwanted messages or clicking stuff repeatedly (like \"stop spamming me with texts!\" or \"he spammed the jump button in the game\").\n\nYour example about parking lots is creative! It‚Äôs not¬†super¬†common to use it that way, but honestly, in casual talk or online, people might get what you mean especially if it‚Äôs exaggerated or ironic. I‚Äôve seen gamers say stuff like \"he spammed buildings everywhere\" in RTS games, so it‚Äôs not totally unheard of.",
      "In your second example, it doesn't mean \"place/build something,\" instead it's a metaphor that is comparing \"placing parking lots\" to sending spam emails (as in: haphazardly, without thought or regard for decency).",
      "The second example is a good way to use it. And I very much agree with it as well ü§£",
      "You can use it to mean 'doing something repeatedly', but as other people said, it's usually used in a digital context. You *can* use it in a non-digital context, but it'll just sound a bit funnier, like you're trying to be humorous for the most part.",
      "Other people have explained it well, but I‚Äôll add that the uses ‚Äúpressing buttons many times‚Äù and ‚Äúfilling an area with a million copies of the same thing‚Äù are primarily used by people online and by young people who are very engaged with the internet; they haven‚Äôt fully made it into mainstream English. Most young people would know what you meant, and some middle-aged people would be able to figure it out, but it‚Äôs not something older people would know, and it‚Äôs casual speech.",
      "I would definitely understand your second usage and I would assume that you had picked it up from watching Minecraft videos.",
      "\"the only word of which is \"spam\".\" - Not quite true. It also has words like \"glorious\", \"wonderful\" to describe the spam! But 99% is indeed spam.  \nOn a more serious note, I wouldn't personally understand spam as the only thing in the modern sense. It seems to me, spam is about something being a) too much and b) unwanted. Possibly also c) untargeted. That still makes the sentence from the OP perfectly fine, but might change the perceived meaning for some.",
      "[The sketch in question.](https://youtu.be/anwy2MPT5RE?si=4qv_MV1tauPPklMR)\n\nThe usage started when someone made the observation that their email inbox was like the menu items in the sketch - ‚Äúspam, spam, spam, spam, real email, spam, spam, real email, and spam.‚Äù",
      "Also to add, the context of Spam at that time was that meat (and other goods) were rationed in the UK from the start of WWII in 1939 until 9 years post-war, in 1954.  So those guys grew up having to eat crappy spam instead of beef or other good meat.  And so for them, Spam was something that was abundant and low quality.",
      "That makes sense. Thank you for the detailed explanation!",
      "Thanks! I was actually thinking about city-building video games, where you can easily end up making a mess of parking lots all around",
      "Just wanted to share, I'm in a server called [VozMate](https://discord.com/invite/BMFTEhk28w). It's not huge, but it‚Äôs super friendly and focused on helping people improve their English.

      "Amazing movie by the way!",

      "This could be contextual to the region. Where I live in the Pacific Northwest, ‚Äúup‚Äù is usually north along the I-5 corridor, and south is ‚Äúdown.‚Äù We might also say ‚ÄúI‚Äôm going over to [a city to the east or west]‚Äù or sometimes ‚ÄúI‚Äôm going *out* to [a city to the east or west].‚Äù",
      "\"Down\" is used colloquially in a lot of regional dialects to describe 'south of or below where you usually are'.\n\nIf you're from New York and you're visiting Atlanta (geographically south), people might ask \"what brings you all the way down here?\".

In my village for instance, most of the houses are around the top of the village, so whenever we're going anywhere, we say we're going \"down the road\", \"down \\[to\\] the pub\", \"down to the shops\", because almost everything is downhill from our houses. This then transfers when we go to other places. It may not literally be down a hill, but we'll say \"down the road\" still because we're used to it. In other places the same will happen with 'up'.",

      "I might quibble that it's not even \"technically true\" in the conventional use of the English language.  If someone told you, \"I slept for 2 hours last night\", there's no way you're going to hear that and think, \"Ah, that means they were factually asleep for 2 of the hours during the night, but I am unsure about the remaining hours, I should ask a follow up question to see if they slept additional hours beyond those two.\"  You're gonna assume they slept for *only* 2.\n\nPeople don't always say \"only\" to limit their statement.  If I heard someone say, \"my flight was 4 hours\" I'm not going to think, *\"they didn't say* only\\*, so it could possibly be more...\\*.\"  But certainly one could say, \"My flight was only 4 hours.\"\n\nIf I read a statement, \"The Boeing 947 can fly 12 hours\", I'm 100% assuming that the 12 hours is some sort of an upper limit.  That's just how we infer meaning.\n\nSo I'd say A) is wrong according to the rules of communication.  The article never says \"The plane can fly \\_\\_\\_\\_ hours\", as if you're getting an upper limit... and that's how it would be understood by any native/proficient speaker.\n\n(edit first sentence to say \"not technically true in the conventional sense\")"

      "Poor question/answer setup, imo, as both a and b work. c comes close, and most would understand it, but 'should' implies optionality, which is already inferred by giving a consequence for not, meaning a should here would project a scenario where you don't show your passport but can still board, and is technically incorrect.",

However, the fact that I clarified that with \"must\" shows the difference. \"Should\" implies there might be other options and would never be said in regards to something as highly regulated as air travel.",

For example, if I say \"I must finish this essay today\", that could be because I have other work to do tomorrow, even though the deadline is the day after. In that case, \"I have to finish this essay by the day after tomorrow\" would indicate that the university requires it by then. I assume the correct answer will be given as A for this reason. In this particular instance, I think they are virtually interchangeable in normal usage, so it is just not a great question.",

If they don't, something bad will happen, and since they'd never want that, they \"must\" follow.\n* Passengers \"are asked to\" do this. If they don't, what will happen is (blah blah). It's not like 'end of the world' serious MUST thing.\n\nThe options \"must\" and \"have to\" fit in each case. \"should\" sounds like somewhere in between, and I also feel this very slight notion of imposing a moral or spontaneous obligation.

      "\"Abroad\" is an adverb in the phrase \"be abroad.\" The way they are being is abroad.\n\nAdjectives modifies nouns, whereas adverbs modify verbs and adjectives. So in both cases, *\"to be*\" is the verb that is modified, making it an adverb.\n\nIt's similar to \"about\" when that word is used as an adverb in phrases like\n\n\"There were many people about.\"\n\nThe way you know it's not an adjective is that you can't really say \"look at all those abroad people.\"",
      "It absolutely is used as an [adjective](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/abroad).",

      "*Abroad* is both an adverb and adjective.\n\nThe fact that we can't say \"those abroad people\" doesn't mean that *abroad* is not an adjective. Adjectives that begin with the a- prefix are not used prepositively, i.e. before the noun they modify. We couldn't use words like *alive*, *asleep*, *awake*, *alone* in that place either, but those are all clearly adjectives.\n\n*Abroad* when used with *be* is an adjective. We can say \"I am abroad\" the same way we can say \"I am awake\".",
      "Ooh, so it really is a nuance. That similarity to \"about\" cleared this confusion for me hehe. It's just weird, because it could easily just have a proper definition as a pure adjective, if only its adverb form is *abroad****ly****.*",

      "\"I am abroad\" isn't using it as an adjective, as per the OP. It is an adverb modifying the verb \"to be.\"\n\nIn other words, \"I am being in an abroad fashion.\" YOU are not abroad, but the way you are being is abroad.\n\nAnother example is \"here.\" \"I am here.\" \"Here\" is not an adjective, it modifies \"am\" and not \"I.\"\n\nDirections and locations are adverbs. \"I am up.\" \"I am down.\" \"I am left.\" etc.\n\nIf it were an adjective you could say \"look at all those abroad people\" or \"look at all those here people.\" But, you can't because they're not.",

      "Your accent sounds good to me. A native English speaker would be able to tell that your first language is French, but you aren‚Äôt difficult to understand. If someone isn‚Äôt expecting to hear an accent, sometimes it can take the brain a second to adjust, but once they do, it should be fine.  \n  \nI don‚Äôt think a perfect accent is important. As long as people can understand you, that‚Äôs all that matters. If anything, in the U.S. people might like your accent. Outside of large cities, most Americans don‚Äôt get to meet that many French people.",
      "Each language/ accent has a phonology (list of sounds) that speakers of that language can say in any word,  as they are a part of the language's inventory. I would look into the phonology of your French accent,  and the accent you want to emulate (General American) and determine which sounds are in General American that aren't in you native language.  These are the sounds you'll need to learn to approximate with a similar sound or learn how to pronounce them. For example, French doesn't have the voiceless glottal fricative (h) and is a sound that can be hard to replicate. Look into the actual mouth mechanics of creating the sounds and try to practice creating them and using them in some English words.",
      ">\"I'm kind of scared to have people not understanding what I'm saying, which happens often.\" \n\nnative English speakers are also used to people with different accents being hard to understand and working around that. we might ask you to repeat yourself or say it a different way, but don't be afraid or nervous to encounter this. it even happens to native English speakers when we go to other English speaking countries with different accents. \n\nyour speech sounds totally fine to me. I can understand everything you say.",
      "As a British person, I'm not getting American - just French. As others have said, your accent is perfectly understandable to me. And... I'm not sure how universal this is, but I think that the French accent is generally regarded as sounding lovely! You're absolutely fine as you are. Genuinely, if people ask you to repeat something, it might be because it sounds so good - I've encountered this with more than one French friend :-)",
      "First, I don't think many Americans would have difficulty understanding you as you speak right now. You have a few issues with vowels (which I can understand; French is very consistent with phonics). For instance, you say \"accent\" like \"ay-sent\", when it needs a hard 'k' sound (\"ak-sent\", think German).\n\nSecond, if you want to learn a particular accent, this is what I recommend. It's what I do when I try to learn accents (a thing I do for fun). Find a recording of someone speaking in your desired accent. Record yourself saying the exact same thing. Listen back, and compare. Identify just one or two ways you didn't quite match the recording. Try again, with those changes in mind. Repeat until you get it.\n\nSome accents come very naturally, based on exposure, and others take more work. For instance, if you're French, you may find it easier to copy accents from the UK, if you happen to have encountered a lot of Brits and British media in your life.",
      "I doubt any native speaker would have trouble understanding you. \n\nA common French accent stereotype which you do is pronouncing the short ‚Äúa‚Äù as an ‚Äúeh‚Äù sound. So when you say ‚Äúaccents‚Äù it sounds like ‚Äúexcents‚Äù and ‚Äúhave‚Äù sounds like ‚Äúhev‚Äù. That was really the only thing that might affect comprehension. You could try to practice the short a sound in words like \n\nBat, hat, pat, that, accent, have. Pay attention to how Americans say these words vs bet, pet, get, and except.",

    "text": "",
    "comments": [
      "What do you mean by a normal book?",
      "Novels are a type of normal books. Possibly the most common kind of book - since so much fiction in so many different genres is published as novels. Science fiction novels. Romance novels. Detective novels. And so on.\n\nThey aren't inherently harder than other books - they vary about as much as any other type of book. The point of a novel is that it's one long story and it gives a lot of reading time with (usually) a lot of repeating vocabulary. It exposes you to the same words over and over again so it can be easier to retain what you learn.\n\nI'm not sure what you mean by \"normal books\". Short story collections? Non-fiction? Poetry? I think whatever interests you is going to be the best choice. Reading novels if they aren't fun for you won't get you nearly as far as reading a book about history if you do enjoy that.\n\nI think everyone's advice is to \\*read\\* - novels just happen to be common and come in a lot of varieties. If you like ghost stories in your native language, you will likely enjoy books about ghosts in English, too. So reading is more likely to be fun and not just a chore. But the advice to \\*just read\\* works just as well if you don't like fiction at all and would rather read books about economics.",
      "So I think I understand what you are saying but first off, a novel IS a normal book. Maybe you‚Äôre talking about fiction vs nonfiction. \n\nSecond I‚Äôve experienced this a bit in my own language studies with another language. It‚Äôs hard to follow a story that is more fantasy/sci fi/magical, etc. because there are a lot of words that are made up and the whole thing may or may not be easy to pick up. There might be nuances or references in the made up concepts that a language learner might not understand. \n\nThat being said, I don‚Äôt think the divide is between fiction and nonfiction but between books more grounded in reality vs more fantastical books. \n\nI wouldn‚Äôt start a person out on reading something like Eragon or The Mistborn Trilogy to learn English because there are too many made up concepts and words. A better place to start would be a slice of life book, a romance novel set in modern times, a realistic drama book, etc. because there‚Äôs less made up fluff compared to real world language.",
      "Most books *are* novels.",
      "do you mean non-fiction when you say 'normal book'?",
      "novels = books",
      "Novels use a wider vocabulary - especially if you are reading classic literature.\n\n¬†One of the reasons novels are recommended to learners is to help widen their vocabulary, as well as because many people like reading fiction and it's assumed that the story narrative will help sustain their attention for longer when they are improving their reading duration in the target language\n\nNon-fiction uses vocab that many learners will already be used to from newspaper articles and from material studied with a view to exams like IELTS. Therefore it probably will seem easier, especially if it's about topics you're interested in and have already consumed quite a lot of shorter content about.",
      "I guess you tried to say nonfiction as a normal book. I granted that nonfiction does feel like an easy stuff than fiction because there are no literary devices such as simile, metaphor, symbol, irony, etc. it just conveys facts with straightforward descriptions.",

That‚Äôs a great goal, reading daily really helps with vocabulary and getting used to natural sentence structures. üòä I personally use BBC News (Easy English) for shorter, simpler articles. If you want something more varied, Newsela is cool because you can adjust the difficulty level. For random fun topics, I sometimes just Google \"topic + ESL article\" (e.g., \"science ESL article\") and find stuff that way.",

      "That‚Äôs great advice from your teacher‚Äîreading real articles daily really helps improve both comprehension and vocabulary!\n\nIf you‚Äôre looking to build your vocabulary while reading, I‚Äôd recommend trying out **Mem-App (**[**https://mem-app.com**](https://mem-app.com)**)**. I built it myself to make vocabulary learning more effective, especially for intermediate and advanced learners. You can look up word meanings instantly while reading (it gives definitions, synonyms, opposites, usage examples, and pronunciation in both US and UK English), and then save the words you want to learn into your personal vocabulary list.\n\nThe app also has flashcards with spaced repetition, so you can actually *remember* the words you pick up. You can install it on your phone, tablet, or computer after browsing the app, and it works seamlessly across devices once you sign in.\n\nIt‚Äôs free for up to 50 words, so you can try it out without any cost or ads. If you‚Äôre already reading articles for practice, this can be the perfect companion to help you grow your vocabulary along the way.\n\nHope that helps‚Äîand happy reading!",

      "Stupid is usually more degrading and means someone lacks in intelligence. It‚Äôs also used more as an adjective than a noun.\n\nDoofus is used more lightheartedly and can mean someone lacking in intelligence, someone who‚Äôs silly, and/or someone who messes around. It is used more often as a noun than an adjective\n\nFor example,\n\n‚ÄúStop being stupid.‚Äù - condescending and used as a descriptor\n\n‚ÄúStop being a doofus.‚Äù - light hearted, may be used between friends and is used as a noun\n\nStupid is a more common word than doofus, at least we‚Äôre I‚Äôm from. Doofus is rarely used as a genuine insult, and if it is the person using it would likely come off as more ‚Äòembarrassing‚Äô than the person it was directed at.",
      "stupid is an adjective whereas doofus is a noun - so you could say ‚Äòthat person is stupid‚Äô and ‚Äòthat person is a doofus‚Äô, but not ‚Äòthat person is a stupid‚Äô or ‚Äòthey‚Äôre doofus‚Äô\n\nDoofus, I would say, is more limited in use. Stupid is universal, but doofus is more North American. Though it would be understood by other English speakers, it would sound strange in British English, for example, unless being used to mimic an exaggerated American accent",
      "Stupid is an adjective*, doofus is a noun. Doofus is also a lot more informal and childish. Not that there's really an adult way to shame someone for their intelligence, but if someone older than 14 called me a doofus I would be kinda surprised.\n\n*if someone said \"you stupid\", I would assume they decided not to continue the sentence. Sometimes it's used as a noun itself, but it's not strictly proper.",
      "doofus is a noun - you're a doofus.\n\nstupid is an adjective - you're stupid.\n\ndoofus works more as a playful insult, not a scathing one.",
      "Great question! Both \"stupid\" and \"doofus\" refer to a lack of intelligence, but they have different tones.\n\n**\"Stupid\"** is a more direct and harsh word. It can be used to describe someone who is making unwise choices or lacks understanding.  \n**Example:** \"That was a stupid mistake.\"\n\n**\"Doofus,\"** on the other hand, is a more playful and light-hearted term. It often implies clumsiness or silliness rather than serious intelligence issues.  \n**Example:** \"He's such a doofus for forgetting his keys again!\"\n\nAs for making sentences, here are a few ways to use both words:\n\n1. \"I felt stupid for tripping over a doofus who was lying on the floor.\"\n2. \"Don't be a doofus; that was a stupid thing to say!\"\n\nFeel free to ask more questions!",
      "\"Stupid\" is insulting. It means you have low intelligence. It's a permanent trait. You lack the ability to make smart decisions or choose wise courses of action. \n\n\"Doofus\" can be insulting, and can mean that you have low intelligence, but it's also kind of silly. Like, you might just be dumb *in this particular instance*, or you might have a tendency to do things before you've really thought them through (but you're smart enough to do better when you take the time to think). But you're not categorically, permanently.... well, you're not *stupid.* It can be an affectionate reproach.",
      "Roughly, the same, with some of the subtleties that have been mentioned. It is also a word that you are more likely to hear in America. For example, it is not a word that we would use here in Ireland, though we would know it.",
      "Doofus by me in Eastern North America has no bite at all. Calling someone stupid is always mean. Calling someone a doofus is old-timey and/or minced oath sounding like \"heck\" or \"shoot\".",
      "\"Stupid\" is more general it can describe someone or something that lacks intelligence (like \"That was a stupid mistake\"). But \"doofus\" is more playful and less harsh it‚Äôs like calling someone a silly or clumsy person, not really mean-spirited. Like if my friend trips over nothing, I‚Äôd laugh and say, \"Nice one, doofus.\"\n\nFor making sentences with two words, it depends are you asking about¬†*just*¬†those two words together? Like \"stupid doofus\" (which sounds kinda funny tbh)? Or any two random words? Either way, context matters a lot!",
      "Stupid is an adjective and doofus a noun. So you can say that stupid doofus burnt dinner.¬†\n\n\nIf people are being mean they can just say the one word stupid short for stupid person or stupid idea... Doofus is the idiot with the stupid idea and can be more light hearted...really tone and context matter",

That seemed very strange to me because in my native languages, we don't say it like that. Later I learned that using \"females\" and \"males\" can actually be considered rude unless it's something like \"female vocalist,\" for example. But now I'm watching a video where a female character is referred to as \"a female\" (without the word \"character\"), and I'm a bit confused. Is that considered rude or is it normal?",
    "comments": [
      "Female is fine as an adjective:\n\nFemale doctor\n\nFemale vocalist\n\nFemale friend\n\n\n\nIt is usually offensive as a noun when referring to humans:\n\n>The females went shopping. \n\n\n\nAlways offensive when paired with a different word for males:\n\n>Men are usually larger than Females.\n\n\nThe noun exception is in technical documents,  when referring to all ages. \n\n>Researchers decided to revisit a study conducted 10 years ago that found females were excluded from most biomedical research based on fears of female hormonal variation complicating the findings.",
      "It is widely considered rude to refer to women simply as \"females.\" It sounds dehumanizing. \n\nYou have correctly understood that using female as a descriptor before some other word to describe a person like \"female vocalist\" or \"female manager\" is fine.",
      "Ok so the issue is using \"female\" or \"male\" as a noun when referring to humans, rather than an adjective. You could call somebody your female friend, for example (though, I would avoid that unless it's relevant to the conversation, in the same way you wouldn't refer to somebody as \"my black friend, Jim\" unless it were actually relevant to the conversation), but to say, for example, \"our tennis team has 5 females and 6 males on it\" reduces those people down to their biological sex and nothing else. \n\nDoes that make sense?",
      "The classic (bad, sexist) example is referring to \"men and females\". You'll also often hear crime reports that talk about \"males\". Both of these usages are dehumanizing and I would discourage you from using them as it makes the men and women in question sound like they're animals or test subjects, not real people.",
      "It‚Äôs a bit complicated and nuanced, but a good rule is you should try to use the terms ‚Äúwomen‚Äù and ‚Äúgirls‚Äù (depending on which is appropriate) whenever possible. \n\n‚ÄúFemales‚Äù can be considered dehumanizing, _especially_ when a speaker/writer would use ‚Äúguys/men/boys‚Äù in the same context. Recently, it tends to be often used in spheres where men make sweeping, reductive statements about women, so the connotation has become even worse. \n\ne.g. ‚ÄúMen like to xyz, whereas females like to abc‚Äù is very often considered degrading because men/women are getting different language treatment. \n\nEven in contexts when men are not explicitly referenced can carry this association, like ‚ÄúI was dating this female, and xyz‚Äù. In that sentence, ‚Äúwoman‚Äù or some equivalent is readily available, and it would be odd to hear the equivalent sentence with ‚Äúmale‚Äù, so this would be often considered degrading. \n\nHowever, there are some contexts where it‚Äôs completely acceptable: ‚ÄúIn humans, the male reproductive system xyz, whereas the female reproductive system abc‚Äù.",

Speaking that way can give the impression that you see women as another species devoid from men entirely, even if that‚Äôs not the intention.",

This terminology is most commonly used by misogynists, particularly common among the redpill community, and/or Andrew Tate and people aligned with him.",
      "Im a native English speaker and I always say \"female\" and \"male\". I always found it easier to use the clinical, professional term instead of doing all the nuances of: \"is this a man? Is this a boy? Is this a young man?\". \n\n\"She's going to the bar with her female friends.\"\n\n\"The females are all in the living room.\"\n\n^ These sound perfectly fine to me, not rude.",
      "There‚Äôs a subtle but very real difference in ‚ÄúShe is female‚Äù and ‚ÄúShe is a female.‚Äù  The former is fine. The latter should be avoided.",
      "I would definitely avoid using male and female as nouns for humans. It sounds derogatory and objectifying. It‚Äôs common police-speak also, with the same mood, or worse. A man, a woman; a female officer, a male suspect.",
      "Using \"female\" as a noun is typically considered rude in American English. The video you linked in the comments is apparently for comedic purposes. I personally wouldn't take it too seriously as a representative sample of the language. Some people do use \"females\" and \"males\" casually, with no disrespectful intention, but it can be complicated. Certain men do use \"female\" as a noun with emphatically dehumanizing, misogynist intention.\n\nContext also affects this; you will even notice \"male\" and \"female\" often used as nouns in law enforcement records and statements. For example, here's a Philadelphia police official describing a slain man.\n\n[‚ÄúAs they were approaching, a scuffle ensued with the male and the officers, at which point in time, the male produced a handgun from a bag that he was carrying on his person,‚Äù said Stanford.](https://whyy.org/articles/philadelphia-officer-involved-shooting-armed-suspect/)\n\nWhether the police shooting was justified or not, that language is dehumanizing. I'm sure Stanford would disagree, but I digress.\n\nIn any case, err on the side of caution and stick to using \"female\" and \"male\" as adjectives, not nouns.\n\nEDIT: Fixing typos.",
      "\"Female\" as a noun for humans in particular can be icky since that sort of language is often associated with some less than savoury groups so it can come off kind of yucky. It's less bad if you also refer to \"males\" at the same time but still typically a slight bit strange. It's not to say it's never acceptable, but it's definitely very context-dependant. You might see it in like, a scientific context, but I'd avoid it in usual speech since it can be kind of reductive/dehumanizing.",

    "text": "Lately I‚Äôve been rethinking how I deal with procrastination, especially in english learning.\n\nA common metaphor is climbing a mountain‚Äîwhen you focus too much on the summit, and measure every step against how far you still are, it can feel overwhelming and demotivating. People often say, ‚ÄúJust look at your feet. One step at a time.‚Äù That helps, but I found another mental shift that works even better for me.\n\nInstead of looking at the summit as the goal, I started using the North Star as my metaphor. The¬†**North Star**¬†gives you¬†**direction**, not distance. It‚Äôs so far away that there‚Äôs no point measuring how close I am to it. But if I know I‚Äôm moving in the right direction‚Äîeven by a tiny step‚ÄîI feel a sense of purpose. That‚Äôs powerful.\n\nFor example, I ask myself:\n\n* Am I becoming the kind of person who uses english naturally?\n* Does this small action (like reading a paragraph or listening for 10 minutes) align with that identity?\n\nIf yes, then even a small effort feels meaningful.\n\nThis mindset shift helped me stop obsessing over short-term goals like ‚Äúreach B2 by August,‚Äù and focus more on building a life that includes the english. Now I think less about progress in miles, more about alignment in direction.\n\nCurious if anyone else has tried a similar mental reframe? How do you stay motivated in the long run?",
    "comments": [
      "    That's a really insightful way to approach motivation and consistency! Using the North Star as a metaphor is a great strategy because it helps you focus on your long-term aspirations rather than getting bogged down by immediate achievements or setbacks.\n    \n    For example, you might set a long-term goal such as becoming fluent in English, and then regularly check in with your daily habits to see if they align with that goal. You could ask yourself questions like, \"Am I practicing speaking every week?\" or \"Am I immersing myself in English media?\".\n    \n    This approach helps you feel more empowered by your progress, no matter how small, and reinforces the idea that every little action contributes to who you want to become.\n    \n    It's wonderful to see you exploring different ways to stay motivated.

      "So I looked into the backstory of the song and apparently this song is about Maria being a stripper, and the singer is trying to make her famous.\n\n\nIn this case, selling her out most likely is related to pimping, which is when a man has multiple women that he would manage and give out to customers to have a good time.\n\n\nSo he's saying \"Don't waste this chance I'm giving you\"",
      "These are song lyrics so it's written in a poetic style and the meaning is somewhat open to interpretation\n\nBut without context the meaning of just those words\n\n\"Make it count\" is an idiom generally used to express \"you've got limited opportunities to do something, so do your best with the chance(s) you've got.\"\n\n\"Selling (someone) out\" is an idiom that means: to betray someone for profit or personal gain. \n\nSo we don't know all the details without context. But basically it's saying \"Do your best at (something) with the limited chance you've got because I'm the person who's betraying you.\"",
      "This is just like poetry class and my teacher asking me why the door was red and what the symbolism is behind it",
      "\"Make it count\" - one person might say this to another as a reminder to seize an opportunity. To me, it often has a slight implication that they're casting doubt as well. Another common phrase is, \"This is your last shot. Make it count!\"\n\n\"Selling you out\" - someone's selling out another person when they're profiting from their misfortune. For instance, someone who's part of an organization but leaves because another organization paid them to. \n\nAll together, these lines suggest that the singer's offering the person he's talking to a reminder to seize the opportunity even though he might be unfairly profiting from her efforts. In the context of the song, it seems to mean that he's offering Maria encouragement to tell him her story but recognizes that he's going to make money for the song he's going to write about it. This song, however, has a lot of intentional vagueness and colorful language that leaves room for a lot of interpretation."

      "I live in Wales and I find nothing unusual about your voice for a 19 year old. You have a light Welsh accent and your voice will deepen naturally as you mature through the next few years. Please do not force it into a lower tone; there's nothing worse than young women who develop a ridiculous vocal fry, no doubt thinking  it gives them gravitas but merely irritate all who have to listen to them.",
      "You have a very charming accent and voice. I don't think you need to worry too much about it, especially since it will probably continue to develop. You have the kind of voice that would be very popular for a streamer or vtuber. Your pitch is high but I don't think any English native speaker would think it's strange when you're not drawing attention to it like in this post.",
      "Your pronunciation is excellent, and I wouldn't worry about improving it or your accent beyond what you'll naturally acquire through speaking to other English speakers. If you want your voice to deepen, that will happen to some degree with age, and otherwise there are tutorials for vocal training available on YouTube that may be helpful.",

      "Update: thank you so much for your nice comments!!\n\nThe reasons why I want to change my voice are: ppl think that im an e-girl cuz of it. either i get creepy men slipping into my dms or ppl think im forcing my voice which really sucks\n\nalso i kind of wanted to fit in a mold since not a lot of people can guess where im from solely listening to my accent\n\nAgain thank you all so much for your encouraging comments!",

      "I agree with others that your accent sounds great and you sound your age. I also didn't really notice a lisp, so if you have one it must be pretty light. If you want your voice to be deeper, that's less an accent question and more a question for a vocal coach.",

Its looks more like a method or a direct object of the verb **play**.\n\nIf I hadn't learnt the phrase already I might go like \"play with your strengths\" or \"play your strengths\".\n\nSo could someone please elaborate on the usage of **to** in this phrase?",
    "comments": [
      "\"play to\" is a phrasal verb. it's the kind of thing that makes us native speakers think, \"huh, I actually have no clue why we say it that way.\" https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/play%20to",
      "It's easier to analyze the phrase if we use a sports example.\n\n\n\nPlay *to* your strengths, in sports, would mean to play in such a way that forces your opponent (or like natural forces like physics or gravity, but the example is clearer with your opponent) to make a move that you know how to counter. For example, if you have a bad backhand in tennis, you could try to hit the ball in a way that tries to make your opponent return the ball to your forehand. The advice is not to just use your forehand, but to try to use your skills to make it easier for you by making it so you only have to use your forehand.\n\n\nPlay to your strengths doesn't mean do what you're good at. It means try to use whatever means you have to make it so you only have to do what you're good at. But in most examples, it ends up being about the same.",
      "I am not sure you have fully grasped the meaning of this phrase.  This phrase is an instruction advising you to capitalise on and leverage your abilities and talents. The preposition **to** is identifying a focus or direction for your effort. So when an actor is told to **play to** the audience in a scene they are being told to direct their performance towards the audience, not their fellow players. When I say the used-car salesman was **playing to** my vanity I am describing how he directed his sales schtick at my ego, leveraging my vanity. \n\nSo when we **play to x*\" we are focusing our efforts in a specific direction to capitalise on, gain from focusing in that direction.",
      "There‚Äôs not really any rhyme or reason; that‚Äôs just what we say. That‚Äôs kind of how it goes with prepositions a lot of the time",
      "This is an idiom which originates in sport.  \nIn sport, you want to move the ‚Äòplay‚Äô towards the areas you are strong.  Hence the preposition to.",
      "You are not playing the strengths themselves, you are taking advantage *of* them.",
      "Lots of idioms use sporting analogies. You play games, such as football. If you play using your best abilities wisely, you're more likely to win.\n\nThe exact wording of idioms doesn't matter. They have a meaning that is independent of the individual words. They're set phrases.",
      "\"Play to(wards) your strength\" is the intended meaning",
      "Adding on, you can play to the audience or play to the music. They all have a sense that you are playing to something that you aren't really in control of, but they are influencing how you play. However, some speakers might not think of it the same way as I do. Prepositions are difficult because they have so many functions that are abstract and are very context dependent. \"Play to the audience\" could be describing what an actor is doing on stage literally or describing how an actor is taking the audience into account to inform their performance. A lot of prepositions will have vague metaphorical meanings that kind of make sense to native speakers, but we can't always explain why. You just have to learn them as you go along, but the more meanings you learn for each preposition, the more you start to see the bigger cloud of metaphors that each preposition is used for.\n\nIt might be interesting to take some common verbs that take many prepositions and see how each preposition changes each verbs meaning. Look at the literal meanings and the metaphorical meanings. How are 'play to' and 'play on' used? How about 'set to' and 'set on'? Then compare 'play to' and 'set to'. Then 'play on' and 'set on'. Try to come up with metaphors that connect each meaning, even if it's pretty silly. After all, it's pretty silly that a class of words so small can take on such wildly different meanings.",
      "It's the same use of \"to\" as in a phrase like \"appeal to\" or \"speak to.\"\n\n\"he appeals to my sense of charity by asking if I know there are children starving in Africa.\"\n\n\"but that doesn't speak to the ethical problems of such a project.\"\n\nAlso...\n\n\"play to your strengths\"\n\n\"appeal to your emotions\"\n\n\"speak to those issues\"\n\nIt's \"to\" in the sense of \"in the direction of\" or \"with regard to.\"\n\nIt really means \"play \\[with regard\\] to your strengths\"",
      "Play to maximize your strengths shortened to play to your strengths¬†",
      "Don't analyse why we use certain prepositions in fixed expressions; that way lies madness.\n\n\nWe use it because we use it. The same is true for phrasal verbs. Sometimes there's a logical reason (e.g. *quiet down* - we often put volume and other measurements on an up-down scale) and sometimes there's no real reason (e.g. *set off an alarm*).",
      "I didn't know the phrasal verb. That's very instructful. Thank you!",

      "Maybe is a regional thing, but I'd end that with \"shouldn't I?\" instead of \"hadn't I?\"",
      "Oof, weird example. \n\nHad + better is a verb phrase that signifies obligation, it is an idiomatic expression that does the work of ‚Äúought‚Äù or ‚Äúshould,‚Äù but implies a negative consequence or urgency that these words don‚Äôt convey. But the dependent clause using ‚Äúhadn‚Äôt‚Äù would sound weird to a lot of anglophones. \n\nMost would use ‚ÄúI‚Äôd better‚Äù for the first clause, and ‚Äúshouldn‚Äôt I‚Äù for the second since the ‚Äúhadn‚Äôt‚Äù on its own loses that idiomatic meaning without ‚Äúbetter.‚Äù",

      "\"didn't I\" would be asking if this had already happened \n\n\"hadn't I\", paired with \"I had better\" instead is asking if they should do the thing. This sentence construction isn't as common as it used to be.",

    "comments": [
      "You can say \"A balloon popped.\" Given they heard the sound of the balloon popping, the context will tell them you're not referring to some balloon from halfway across the world but to one you're aware of that was close enough for them to hear pop.\n\nYou can say \"They are hanging on a wall in my room\" if other context makes it clear that, by \"they,\" you mean \"balloons.\"",
      "‚ÄúOne of the balloons‚Äù vs ‚Äúa balloon‚Äù: either one is fine and sounds perfectly natural.  ‚ÄúOne of the walls‚Äù vs ‚Äúa wall‚Äù: either one is fine and sounds perfectly correct, but the latter flows a little better.",

Someone asks ¬´¬†what was that ?¬†¬ª\n\nYour answer could be ‚Äúone of the balloons popped‚Äù, or ‚Äúa balloon popped‚Äù or ‚Äúa balloon‚Äù or if was me ‚Äúwhat do you think‚Äù\n\nFor your second one you could say ‚Äúthey‚Äôre in my room‚Äù if it was already established that you were talking about balloons.",
      "They're all OK. Don't overthink things.",
      "You would only say \"one of the balloons popped\" if the other person was familiar with your 10 bedroom balloons. Otherwise they would be confused and probably reply \"the balloons??\"\n\n\"A balloon popped\" would be correct and in this case refer to \"a balloon nearby, the one you just heard\". Though unless it was common for there to balloons nearby, it would also prompt a followup question.",
      "\"A balloon popped\"  is fine this is not happening in isolation, there is context. Also this informs the person balloons were even there to begin with.\n\n\"A wall in my room\" is also fine. You presented a wall (any wall at all) then described it ( in my room)",
      "1. \"A balloon popped\" is better. \"One of the balloons\" is correct but it also implies the person you're talking to knows you have these balloons.\n2. \"The balloons\" vs \"they\" depends on if you have previously mentioned the balloons. If you say \"the balloons\" in one sentence, you can say \"they\" in a following sentence.",
      "Both are valid. You're better off being specific by saying one of the balloons (assuming the person knows about the balloons).¬†",
      "you can say \"a balloon popped\" - in convo, that just means one balloon in your room popped, not some random one in the world. totally natural.\n\n\"one of the balloons popped\" is just a bit more specific.\n\nsame with \"a wall\" vs \"the wall\" - both work, depends if you're being casual or pointing out something specific.\n\nyou‚Äôve got a good eye for details tho, most folks don‚Äôt even notice stuff like this!",
      "Both ‚Äúone of the balloons‚Äù and ‚Äúa balloon‚Äù work. Yes, you could replace ‚Äúthe balloons‚Äù with ‚Äúthey‚Äù in context, but I‚Äôm not sure how you could hang balloons on a wall.",
      "You can say \"a balloon popped\" because, whilst you're technically correct that it could mean any balloon anywhere in the world, context is our friend here. The person came to investigate a noise, so it's fairly obvious that by \"a balloon\", you mean one of the balloons in your room.\n\nAnyone that doesn't understand that is probably being deliberately obtuse.\n\n\"the balloons are hanging on one of the walls in my room\" is technically correct but EXTREMELY specific. Again, context helps us out. We can infer from the statement that you mean the balloons, and it doesn't matter which wall specifically in this context, so \"they're hanging on a wall in my room\" is perfectly fine.\n\nEven \"hanging\" is probably not needed here. \"They're on a wall in my room\" gives the same information.",
      "\"One of the balloons popped\" assumes that the listener can relate it to a previously mentioned context. He knows which specific balloon you mean. Without context you would say \"a balloon popped\". It could be any ballon, anywhere within hearing.",
      "I can't give a logical reason for this, but I think in this context, I would say ‚Äúhanging on **the** wall in my room,‚Äù rather than ‚Äú**a** wall.‚Äù\n\nAgain, I don't know why, but things hang on **the** wall rather than **a** wall unless there's some other context that drives the use of the indefinite article ‚Äî like ‚ÄúI painted a wall in my room‚Äù i.e., specifying that it's not all four walls ... just one of them.",
      "So the difference between \"a \\[noun\\]\" and \"one of the \\[nouns\\]\" depends on context. Here, the person in the other room has just heard a sound and asked what the sound is. Even if they did not previously know there were balloons in your room, that context is enough that \"a balloon popped\" is a sufficient answer because it tells them the source of the sound they were asking about. \"One of the balloons\" includes additional information about the number of balloons in your room, which may or may not be relevant to a further discussion with the person. \n\nThe context is different in your sentence about where the balloons are hanging. \"On a wall in my room,\" without further context, suggests an ordinary room, and most readers would understand that (1) the balloons are hanging on a wall, and (2) the wall and the balloons are both in your room. Unlike \"one of the balloons,\" \"one of the walls in my room\" doesn't give much additional information. \"A balloon\" could mean there was one or more than one, whereas \"one of the balloons\" means there definitely was more than one. But we already know (or at least presume) that your room has more than one wall, so in this case \"one of the walls\" tells us that the balloons are hanging on one of the walls, and not more; that is, you don't have balloons hanging on two walls, or three. That could be important to the listener or not, depending on the context.",
      "For the balloon scenario, both responses would be appropriate.  \"A balloon popped\" does not seem to imply anything in particular about the balloon, but the listener will still understand your answer to refer to some balloon that has popped within earshot.  Everything else about the balloon is unimportant.\n\n\"One of the balloons popped\" is correct English usage and sounds natural, but will pique the curiosity of the listener if you have not already established to them that you have a number of balloons.  Having a number of balloons in your residence is unusual outside of the context of celebrating something, so they might take your comment to mean that you are having a celebration and ask you about the occasion.\n\nA certain type of person may even take \"one of the balloons popped\" as a joke.  With no other context, this answer implies that it is normal for you personally to always have a number of balloons around, which is sort of funny."

      "No, please for the love of all that is literate, no. Human speakers are how you learn how the language is spoken by humans. AI is an  advanced form of auto complete and should never be used to replace human thought.

However, you need to make the conscious decision to acquire this knowledge and maybe also learn the grammar rules you make (especially true i you're writing in your second language). If you just click \"accept change\" and go next, I don't think you learn a whole lot from using it, although I would still say it can improve your text overall.",
      "Ugh, yes, 100%. Grammarly fixes my writing but my brain doesn't actually learn anything. I went down a rabbit hole with this exact problem. For the first part, learning new words while reading, I've had some luck with browser extensions that let you click on a word to get a definition and save it. It's good for capturing words in the moment.\n\nBut the real problem, like you said, is getting them to stick and actually *using* them. Just saving them to a list wasn't enough for me; they'd go in one ear and out the other. But to actually make them stick, I force myself to *say* them. I use Praktika app, and try to drop my new words into a conversation. It's a judgment-free zone, so I can sound totally awkward trying to use a new word, and it doesn't matter lol.\n\nThat act of actually speaking the word is what finally makes it part of my real vocabulary.üòä",

Try working on daily or weekly new words and phrases, and don't rely on automatic correction software.",
      "kind of not really. having ai fix your text alone won't help you learn, unless you ask it what it fixed. even then, it can be wrong, and may fabricate reasons. before you know it you'll be left thinking using an em dash every other sentence is normal ‚Äî it's not. non-ai resources are definitely better, i wouldn't recommend considering ai use until you know enough that you're able to discern helpful info from inaccuracy. \n\nyou'll also note my casual writing has non-standard quirks. you won't pick up on those with ai, and they're important too. formality and grammatical correctness aren't absolute. if you're not careful, ai can completely flatten the quirks, and real people don't tend to talk like ai. \n\nsome of the quirks in question:\n\"kind of not really\" (technically grammatically incomplete)\n\"non-ai ..., i wouldn't ...\" (comma splice)\n\"before you know it you'll be ...\" (missing comma after it, stylistic but ungrammatical)\n\nand obviously, it's all in lowercase.",

      "AI tools won't improve your English. Reading more will improve your vocabulary. If you like flashcards, I also recommend those as a way of learning words but it's better to learn words in context.

    "title": "A somewhat silly question about the verb 'expect' in the past tense",
    "text": "EDIT :\nThanks everyone for weighing in. I see now how between 1 and 2, a distinction can be drawn mostly stylistically, as pointed out almost unanimously in the comments. I'm more curious now about \"didn't expect to\" being used to refer to things that eventually did not happen. Is it 100% contextual?\n\nHi, here's my very nerdy question to native speakers :)\n\nCompare two sentences below:\n1. I didn't expect this to happen.\nVs\n2. I never expected this to happen.\n\nIn my understanding,  sentence (1) strongly implies that the thing that wasn't expected did actually happen in the end (=\"i didn't expect it but it did happen\"). Whereas sentence (2) can be understood more freely, depending on the context: \"I wasn't hoping for it to happen [and it didn't]\" also a possible interpretation.\n\nDo you agree?\n\nMost importantly, my other question is: can (1) depending on the context allow such an interpretation where 'this' eventually did NOT happen? Or would it be grammatically/semantically impossible, or simply lexically incorrect to be trying to express this meaning with the combination  of 'expect' + negative + past simple? \n\nSome other examples, with broader context:\n\n3. I didn't expect to find a good listener in her,  and indeed she ended up talking over all the time. \n\n4. I went to see that movie last night. I didn't expect it to be a masterpiece, and clearly it wasn't.\n\nDoes this usage of 'expect to...' in (4) & (5) sound slightly off, or is it okay? \n\n",
    "comments": [
      "There is no difference in insinuation in the first to imo",
      "I would not agree, no. You‚Äôre describing things that happened in the past, so if the ‚Äúthis‚Äù incident didn‚Äôt actually happen‚Ä¶you probably wouldn‚Äôt need to describe it. Like if I wasn‚Äôt shot in the street in the cold light of day, I don‚Äôt need to say I didn‚Äôt expect it to happen. In both of these sentences, it‚Äôs implied that whatever ‚Äúthis‚Äù is actually occurred. \n\nI would say that the biggest difference is that the implication of sentence two is much more serious/dramatic than sentence one. To me sentence one is like you‚Äôre doing a science experiment and get an unusual result. It‚Äôs like ‚Äúhuh. ü§î didn‚Äôt expect that to happen.‚Äù \n\nSentence two on the other hand is like if your best friend is killed in a sudden car accident. It‚Äôs like ‚ÄúOh my GOD. üò≠ I never expected this to happen.‚Äù It‚Äôs like, something happened that is so crazy that the thought couldn‚Äôt even cross your mind.",
      "i think either could be used either way, but you're probably sensing a very real difference in which is _more likely_ to be used in the two situations.",
      "P.S. 3 is a bit wrong; \"she ended up and talking over\" doesn't make sense.\n\nMaybe just a typo?",
      "P.P.S. Apologies for missing this question,\n\n> an interpretation where 'this' eventually did NOT happen? \n\nNo. \n\nThey both imply that it's happened. You're describing \"this\". If \"this\" doesn't exist, then it doesn't make sense.\n\nYou'd need to rephrase it. Probably using the word \"but\".\n\n\"I thought it would happen, but it didn't.\"",
      "To me, the key word in examples 1 and 2 is actually ‚Äúthis‚Äù. A thing or event described as ‚Äúthis‚Äù is close to the speaker, and the easiest way to be close is if it actually recently happened. ‚ÄúThat‚Äù event is a little farther away, and there could be many reasons why it‚Äôs farther away so ‚Äúthat‚Äù works for both did-happen and did-not-happen. But it would be very rare to say ‚ÄúI did not expect this‚Äù when ‚Äúthis‚Äù is not real.\n\nBack to comparing ‚Äúdid not expect‚Äù and ‚Äúnever expected‚Äù. To me, this one isn‚Äôt about whether it happened. Instead, ‚Äúnever expected‚Äù implies that your thought process would stay the same even given multiple opportunities to consider the question (whether real or hypothetical opportunities), and/or given different combinations of related circumstances. Your prediction may have been incorrect, but you never would have been *uncertain* about your prediction.\n\n‚ÄúDid not expect‚Äù is not the opposite of this. It doesn‚Äôt imply that you were uncertain. It just doesn‚Äôt include that information at all. You can use that for any level of certainty.",
      "They're very, very similar.\n\nI think you're overthinking it.\n\nThe slight difference - in some contexts - is, the second implies that you'd thought about it before - i.e. you had given consideration to what might happen, even though it didn't. It focuses more on the possibilities.\n\nWhereas 1 is more \"ooh, wow, surprise\". Totally unexpected - impossible to predict. C/f. 2 is like... yeah, I could have worked out that that might happen, but I didn't.\n\nBut you're overthinking it.\n\nThey're *so* nearly the same.",
      "\"I didn't win, but I didn't expect to anyway.\"\n\n\n\"I won, but I didn't expect to.\"¬†",
      "Thanks! Meaning, to you both mean 'this' did eventually happen?",
      "Thank you so much for your input! I see it now.  I'm still very curious as to whether \"expect\" would allow usages like 3 and 4, where the event did not happen (it wasn't expected > it didn't happen).",
      "So we could say this just depends on the context, and both 3 & 4 sound alright?",
      "Indeed a typo! Thanks!",
      "No they don't. I'm with a friend, I receive a letter, I open it: it's from a college I applied to, and it's a rejection. My friend says, \"oh no, I'm sorry\" and I shrug and say \"I didn't expect to get in.\"",
      "Thanks a lot. So what about sentence 3 & 4? Would they similarly sound more natural with different endings, like below?\n3* ... but she listened with empathy and care\n4* ...but it was brilliant",
      "I can totally see now how \"this\" works to that effect in sentences 1 & 2. Somehow I didn't think of it, but now it's clear."

      "I think that's pushing credulity somewhat, because it says \"Sports is\", so it's talking about the entirety of that pursuit. The competition for sports, as a genre, would be e.g. computer games or board games - competing with sport, rather than competitors in sports games. Even if it said \"**the** competition\", it still doesn't make much sense, because what are they competing *with?* \n\nTechnically, I guess it could work. But it's probably not worth thinking about; these types of English exercise are often poorly constructed.",
      "Yes, agreed, if \"Sports\" were a single subject (say, at school), I could see that working in some scenarios. It's not one I've ever encountered in real-world usage so far. I'd more naturally interpreted this sentence to be referring to the generalised group of sports (e.g. cricket, rugby, etc) that people play, and being a group object."

I can explain more, if you want. It's kinda my thing. Coincidentally, I am reading Dickens literally right now. But Great Expectations. Because someone on this forum asked a question about a passage from it, a couple of weeks ago... so I borrowed a copy from my sister.

      "\"Embrace\" here is a metaphor. Education does not have arms and cannot literally embrace anything. In this situation, you might find it helpful to think of \"embrace\" to mean \"include,\" or \"encourage,\" as in \"education should include imagination and morality.\" At the time that Dickens was writing, education focused a great deal on conformity, memorization, and repetition. In this sentence, he's encouraging his readers to \"embrace\" a warmer, softer style of education.\n\nSide note: the teacher in *Hard Times* is Mr. M'Choakumchild, which is a thinly veiled aptronym (when a character's name is apt or appropriate to their personality or behavior). Mr. M'Choakumchild sounds like \"choke the child.\"  I can't quite remember the scene correctly because I haven't taught the book in twenty years, but he demands that a student define a horse in very scientific terms with no tolerance for whimsy or creativity. \"You wouldn't walk on a horse, so a carpet should not have images of horses on them,\" or something along those lines.",
      "Oh, I think you're using \"embrace\" perfectly here! üòä It sounds natural and fits the idea of education¬†*welcoming*¬†or¬†*including*¬†imagination and morality. Dickens would probably approve, he loved criticizing rigid education systems lol.",
      "Embrace is perfect.  \nYou could consider:\n\nInvolve - the easiest to understand,\n\nEntail - a more formal synonym for involve.  \n\nEncompass - more formal, less positive connotation synonym for embrace.  \n\nIntegrate - connotes combination into a whole.\n\nIncorporate - similar to integrate.\n\nConsist of - neutral register\n\nComprise - formal version of consist of\n\nBlend / merge / unite etc.  - imply only these two things.  \n\nDraw in / rope in / enlist - more idiomatic",

      "\"Drawing\" pictures doesn't fit with the verb \"do.\" Drawing is a gerund (a noun form of a verb, like building, dancing), and they don't typically work with \"do\"",
      "This is a cleft (or pseudo-cleft) sentence. **Cleft sentences** usually take the complement or object, and make it the focus of the sentence:\n\n*e.g. It's money that he wants.*\n\n(the normal sentence is: *He wants money.*)\n\nThis is done for emphasis.\n\nA **pseudo-cleft sentence** is a way of reversing a sentence with a copular verb (or 'linking' verb), like '*be*' or '*become*'. Pseudo-cleft sentences begin with question words (e.g. What, Why, Where), however in this case, the pseudo-cleft sentence begins with '*All*', which has the same meaning as '*the only things that*'.\n\nThe form in the second clause depends on the verb in the first clause. For example, '*need to*' is followed by **the bare infinitive**: \n\ne.g. *What you need to do is* **write** *him a letter.*\n\nNoun clauses starting with 'that' would use a normal verb in **indicative**:\n\ne.g. *All that matters is (that) she* **gets** *home safe.*\n\nWhereas verbs like '*enjoy*' are always followed by **'-ing'** so this would be in the second clause too.\n\ne.g. *The only thing I enjoy is walking in the forest.*",

Looking forward to other answers.\n\nEdit: More examples that use this rule:\n\nWhat I need you to do is talk to your sister.\n\nThe only thing you should do is make me cookies.\n\nExploring these examples makes me consider the parallel with /do/‚Äã in the first clause, which is the infinitive and may prompt the infinitive in the second.\n\nCompare:\n\nWhat I'm doing is sending you a letter.\n\nAll I'm doing is talking to you. ‚Äã\n\nThe verb is -ing in both cases. I think we have an answer.\n\nEdit 2: Removed commas eg What I did, was say hello. ‚Äã",
      "\"Draw\" is an infinitive verb form there, and these are also sometimes used in the same places as nouns (note that they do not become nouns though - you can tell it's still a verb because it has a direct object, \"pictures\").\n\nThis kind of structure (e.g., \"All I do is ...\") simply requires an infinitive as complement rather than an \"-ing\" form.\n\nYou can kind of compare it to how certain verbs can only take infinitives, e.g., \"I can read,\" not \"I can reading.\"",
      "It feels to me like its usage is verb, it‚Äôs just that the writer dropped the preceding ‚Äúto‚Äù, which would be there if written more formally correct",
      "In some cases, The gerund and infinitive (I.E. \"Doing\" vs \"(To) do\", Etc.) are effectively interchangeable, \"I like walking\", \"I like to walk\"; \"I wanna go hiking\", \"I wanna go hike\" (Sometimes the word \"To\" is used, Sometimes not, It depends on the verb before, In this case \"Go\" doesn't have \"to\").\n\n\"Do\" is one of the aforementioned verbs that takes the bare infinitive (I.E. wothout \"To\" before it), So \"I didn't walk\" (Not \"I didn't to walk\"), \"All he does is talk\" (Not \"All he does is to talk\"), Etc. In this case you probably *could* use the gerund, \"All she'd usually do [...] was drawing\", And it'd certainly be understood, But it sounds more natural to use the infinitive \"Draw\", I'm not sure if there's actually a rule about it. In general though, If a verb is the object of the verb \"Do\" rather than another verb, It's probably best to put it in the infinitive. (For the examples I gave, \"I didn't walking\" doesn't make sense, \"All he does is talking\" works, But it sounds a bit weird and \"All he does is talk\" would probably be more common.)\n\n(N.B.: I'm not sure \"Object\" is really the best word, In a phrase like \"All he does is play tennis\", \"Tennis\" is the object, With \"Play\" I suppose acting as the main verb, But it's in some way connected to \"Does\". Perhaps \"Complement\" would be a more accurate term?)",

But now I believe it‚Äôs actually coming form the word before in ‚Äúshe‚Äôd‚Äù. The word being folded into she there is ‚Äúwould‚Äù indicates the possibility of the past tense potential subjunctive to me which dictates the verb usage ‚Äúwas draw‚Äù instead of the past continuous as you have suggested here.",

Would you say \"All that matters is she gets home safe\"? There are some cases where it feels natural to drop \"That\" (E.G. \"I think that he's coming\", \"I know that he will\"), But in this particular case it'd sound really weird to me without \"That\", I'm genuinely not even sure I'd understand it, Not without thinking about it a bit.",

      "I don't have the formal English language education to explain why, but when using \"watch\", \"play\" is correct, \"playing\" is not.\n\n\"I watched him play football\" is how it would naturally be said.  \n\"I *saw* him *playing* football\" also sounds correct to me. To mean \"when I saw him, he was playing football\" rather than the first one which has more of an \"I went intentionally to watch him play\" connotation.\n\nThough \"I watched him playing football\" sounds wrong. I can't explain why and it feels like it should be grammatically correct, it's just not something we'd say. I think it has something to do with tenses? It almost has a kind of creepy \"and he didn't know\" connotation, weirdly.\n\nOn the other hand, both 'cross' and 'crossing' scan perfectly fine. \"I saw him cross the road\" and \"I saw him crossing the road\" both feel perfectly fine, though they have slightly different meanings to me.\n\n\"I saw him cross the road\" = that's a thing that he did, and I can vouch for that because I saw him do it.  \n\"I saw him crossing the road\" = when I saw him, he was in the act of crossing the road.\n\nI have no qualifications in English other than being born here - and technically, being from Cornwall, even that's debateable. :p\n\nEdit: Thinking about it more, it's definitely \"a tense thing\", and my cross/crossing explanation explained why playing is wrong. \"Playing\" implies it was a thing that was going on when you were there. Whereas \"watched\" implies that it's a thing in the past that has concluded. \n\nYou watched a TV show, or you're watching a TV show. You can't \"watched\" something that's still happening. So you can't have \"watched\" someone \"playing\" football, because \"watched\" implies you've done it, but the \"playing\" implies it's still happening. That's why it sounds wrong.\n\n'Saw' doesn't have the same implication as 'watched', because you can see something, without necessarily seeing all of it. Which is why \"I saw you yesterday at the shops!\" is fun, but \"I watched you yesterday at the shops\" is probably ending in an arrest.\n\n  \n... am I talking absolute crap here?",

Sorry, I'm not trying to be a dick about this (and possibly failing), I can just see how the clumsy sentence structure might cause further confusion around the subjunctive for somebody who's learning the language.\n\nThe Oxford Languages definition of 'delusion' is 'a false belief or judgment **about external reality**, held despite incontrovertible evidence to the contrary', which makes the subjunctive mood inherently inappropriate. It should either be 'Gates's persistent delusion that Windows *was* like the Mac' or another word entirely.",

      "To quote from the mighty Wikipedia: 'Subjunctive forms of verbs are typically used to express various states of **unreality**, such as wish, emotion, possibility, judgment, opinion, obligation, or action, **that has [sic] not yet occurred**.' So pairing the subjunctive mood with something like 'delusion' ‚Äì which explicitly references **reality** ‚Äì is incoherent.",
      "But in that very definition it states that a delusion is a false belief that is not in line with reality which seems to be exactly in line with the ‚Äúunreality‚Äù found in subjunctives. Cambridge dictionary defines delusion as ‚Äúsomething a person believes and wants to be true, when it is actually not true‚Äù. My definition doubly reinforces the subjunctive by referencing the state of wanting and showing that it‚Äôs not true which helps move it from the indicative mood, at least to me it does.",
      "The key part is 'something a person believes ‚Ä¶ to be true', i.e. from the perspective of the deluded, the delusion and the current reality are indistinguishable. In the case of a wish or a hope, the subject appreciates their wish or hope is currently unfulfilled. Compare the following:\n\n1. He believes the sky is green. (simple present)\n\n2. He believes the sky were green. (subjunctive)\n\n3. He wishes the sky were green. (subjunctive)\n\n4. He wishes the sky is green. (simple present)\n\n1 expresses a delusion, but it requires the simple present tense ('is') to do so. Substituting it with the subjunctive creates a sentence that is nonsensical. In 3 and 4, the inverse is true.\n\nI appreciate that doesn't provide a very satisfying explanation in the abstract, and maybe I misspoke with my previous comment, but hopefully that clarifies things a bit?",
      "I don't have the grammatical information to contribute to this, but I would like to say that the subjunctive would be used (i'm still a learner) with \"delusion\" in Spanish (which has a robust subjunctive system), but not your example 1.\n\"su ilusi√≥n de que Windows *fuera* como Mac\" &¬†\"√âl cree que el cielo *es* verde\"\nI know it's not the best practice to compare language to language, but I thought it could be relevant somewhat.\nIf it turns out I'm wrong on this, disc√∫lpame, I'll delete this."

      "I'm a native English speaker in the US. I've taught English as a second language to adult adults from all over the world. My advice is not only to just watch TV in English, but to stand or sit in front of the TV and insert yourself into the scenes of programs, especially \"soap operas\". Pretend you're one of the characters, or an extra person in the scene, and respond to what's being said. Maybe try to guess what the other character is going to say in response to the person who has just spoken to him.\n\nAlso, because television news usually has better grammar than sitcoms, watch the news and repeat after the reporters. Do this out loud. If you're home alone, that's even better. There are other people in your house, they can just learn to deal with you talking to the TV. Good luck!

    "title": "Present perfect is mysterious to me",
    "text": "Hi everyone!\n\nIt's in the title: I am coming here for some enlightenment. I feel like I understand pretty well when to use the present perfect: to talk about undated past experiences, events that finished very recently and overall events that still connect to the present (am I right ?) (even if the latest doesn't always make sense to my non-native English speaker's brain, as presently talking about past events seems enough to it for them to be connected).\n\nHowever when I think about some examples, I am left with questions. Let's say that I have to explain to someone that my friend is not coming to their party because her leg is broken. I feel like I could actually use preterit as well as present prefect, the last one allowing me to focus on the fact that the leg is still broken (and that my friend can't walk as a consequence, or something) : \"She isn't coming because she broke her leg\" / \"She isn't coming because she's broken her leg\". However if one were to use the preterit tense, would the other speaker not understand that my friend's leg is still broken? Is my example just a bad one or can such a misunderstanding happen if one were to choose the wrong form?\n\nAny additional info about preterit/present perfect is welcome!",
    "comments": [
      "Something no one's mentioned yet is that using the present perfect in situations like your example sentences is more common in the UK. I think Americans tend to use simple past (preterit I guess) when possible. To me the present perfect sounds \"fancy\" or kind of British in this usage. \n\nSimilarly, when making sentences that use \"just\" or \"already\" I think Americans also tend to use simple past.\n\n\"I already ate.\" (more American) vs \"I've already eaten.\" (more UK)\n\nI've noticed my friend from the UK sometimes uses present perfect when I (American) would use simple past. In fact I think you can usually use simple past, the only exception I can think of is a sentence like \"I've lived in Japan for three years\", this means you still live there. If you say \"I lived in Japan for three years.\" it means you don't live there any more. That's what comes to mind at least.",
      "I would assume the leg is still broken in either of those sentences, and both make sense and work grammatically. In this case, there‚Äôs very little difference between the two. That‚Äôs not always true, but the context here makes the meaning clear.",
      "Both of your examples would work just fine.",
      "Never heard of the preterit tense in English, but on investigation, it turns out to be the past tense, as in your example. The use of the present perfect makes it clear that the leg is still broken. Although one might assume the same from the use of the past tense, there is a possibility that it is now healed and her inability to come is a consequence of the broken leg, such as having to catch up with her studies or work now she is fully fit.",
      "Let's tease the leg-breaking examples apart.\n\nShe's not coming to the tournament because she's broken her leg\nShe's not coming to the tournament because she broke her leg\n\nThese are about the same.\n\nShe's not coming to the tournament because she broke her leg half a year ago.\n\nAnd so the real difference is here - the pp implies that she's not coming because her leg is still broken, the past tense because she broke her leg (but it doesn't have to still be broken, it might just have ruined her chance at training for the tournament!)",
      "In the example you provided, either would work. However, as someone else mentioned, \"she has broken her leg\" sounds like something more recent (and is a bit less natural, IMO, almost like you are from England). Saying that she \"broke her leg\" doesn't mean the leg is healed, it just means the incident itself was isolated to the past.\n\nIt can be hard to predict which one to use, unfortunately. A lot of examples are fixed constructions where only one will work, and it gets more confusing when you add the continuous e.g. \"I've been helping my grandma\" vs. \"I have helped my grandma\" vs. \"I helped my grandma.\"\n\nMy recommendation is to use the preterite as the default and switch to the present perfect in situations you are sure about or where you hear native speakers using it. Non-native speakers are not reliable indicators and often get this wrong.",
      "While both would be understandable, in my opinion the first (\"She isn't coming because she broke her leg\") sounds more natural. However, I‚Äôm also an American. British English uses present perfect more often than American English. Therefore, the correct use of present perfect depends on whether you are learning American English or British English.",
      "In your example, saying \"She has broken her leg\" sounds like you're reporting \"fresh\" news closer to now whereas \"she broke her leg\" is something that occurred in the past and was completed and taken care of in the past, like it's not connected to the present at all. There was some time between the leg being broken and now.\n\nThe present perfect tense tells you something happened = true but nothing about when it happened, or how many times. It may even still be going on right now!\n\nThere's such a thing as \"weasel words\" where we can try to misdirect or say things that are technically correct by the rules but not answering what someone is asking about and answering in the present perfect is one of the ways to avoid saying something.\n\nLike if I say \"I cheated on a test\" then people are probably going to hear \"I cheated on a test in the past (once or twice)\". Whereas if I say \"I have cheated on a test\" that is technically correct for everything from cheating once to cheating on every single test I've ever taken and even the test I'm currently taking now (I'm trying to cover up that I've done this thing many times and I am even currently doing it!).\n\nOut of curiosity I looked up \"present perfect\" online to see what official stuff says. Here's [the first site](https://learnenglish.britishcouncil.org/grammar/english-grammar-reference/present-perfect) that comes up for me.\n\nIt says to use it for something that started in the past and continues into the present:\n\n* She has lived in Liverpool all her life (she has lived there her whole life and still is living there)\n* She lived in Liverpool all her life (she died, never having lived anywhere other than Liverpool)\n\nOr for an experience up to the present:\n\n* I've seen that film before (this is more like \"I am familiar with this film, but it's sort of fuzzy and I can't remember specifics about it\")\n* I saw that film before (this sounds more solid like you definitely remember the film and could talk about it)\n* I've played the guitar ever since I was a teenager\n   * I played the guitar since I was a teenager (\"since\" sort of clashes with \"played\" because \"played\" sounds \"complete and over\")\n* He has written three books and he is working on another one (sounds like 'the writing' is an ongoing matter, it's not closed or finished)\n* He wrote three books and is working on another one (the 'he wrote' just sounds \"final & completed\" like he wrote his 3 books and said all he had to say)\n\nI have a coworker who is Polish and he told me the hardest thing about English is the verb tenses. The thing with our verb tenses is we use them to talk about when the action happened, whether the action is complete or on-going, and what the relationship is with other actions is (before or during or after).",
      "\"She isn't coming because she broke her leg\" is fine.\n\nOr \"She isn't coming because she HAS broken her leg\".",
      "It sounds as if you understand the present perfect very well.\n\nIn your example, the context (\"She‚Äôs not coming because ‚Ä¶\") makes it clear that you‚Äôre talking of a present situation.  The listener can then deduce that her leg is still broken.  But when a listener doesn‚Äôt have those contextual clues, we may need the present perfect.",
      "You're right about the present perfect generally connecting past events to the present, but yeah, sometimes the lines feel blurry. In your example, both¬†\"she broke her leg\"¬†(simple past) and¬†\"she's broken her leg\"¬†(present perfect) work, but they give slightly different vibes. With the simple past, the focus is just on the action happening, while the present perfect kinda hints that it still matters now (like you said, her leg‚Äôs still broken). Most native speakers would assume the leg is still healing either way, unless you specify otherwise (e.g.,¬†\"she broke her leg last year, but she‚Äôs fine now\").",
      "Even though they are not exactly the same they are often interchangeable. Context goes a long way in clearing up ambiguities, and if someone isn't sure what you mean they can always ask for clarification.",
      "Perfect tenses are just as they appear - it tells how an event happen and there's no going back. This is why in the case of future perfect tenses, you got to be extremely confident to use them since it implies how you can potentially eat all of your words in shame.",
      "Thank you for your insight!",

He shows up, for example, in ‚ÄúJack and Jill went up the hill‚Äù, ‚ÄúJack and the Beanstalk‚Äù, ‚ÄúThe House that Jack Built‚Äù. Pretty much every child knows these usages. Jack Tar is a generic name for a British sailor. ‚ÄúEvery man Jack‚Äù is a  way of saying every man. The lowest ranking picture card in a deck of cards is a Jack. \n\nSo Jack came to be used for all kinds of tools, and people. You jack up a car to change a tire, using a jack.

There's a whole series of these.\"\n\nThis is modeled on a series of articles in Reader's Digest that used the name Joe.",

That‚Äôs where we get ‚Äúlumberjack.‚Äù This evolved into ‚ÄúJack‚Äù also meaning the TOOLS for tasks that might have been performed by an assistant. For example: you don‚Äôt need your human friend Jack to lift up your car when a jack (a mechanical device for lifting cars) will do.\n\nFrom there, ‚Äújack‚Äù also became a verb meaning to lift something, and ‚Äújacker‚Äù became an adjective meaning to rob or to steal (i.e. to literally lift something and carry it away). That‚Äôs where we get words like ‚Äúhijack‚Äù (‚Äúhighway jacker‚Äù - person who robs stagecoaches on the highway) and to ‚Äújack in‚Äù (to hack your way into a computer)\n\nTl;dr - you‚Äôll see ‚Äújack‚Äù everywhere in the English language.

They have many choices.  He has many sweaters.  I have many of the same books that you do.  As others have pointed out, ‚Äúclothes‚Äù is a weird word to use for that example.",
      "I think this rule is quite useful, at an appropriate level.  Of course, in some contexts, with some fixed phrases and with some registers, you can use many in a statement in a way that is grammatically correct.  However, this is a rule of use and helps lower-level learners understand how to understand and use quantifiers in the majority of sentences they will find.",
      "Not very.\n\nThe response to that question could in fact be just \"Many.\"\n\n'I have many clothes' doesn't flow as well or sound very natural but there's nothing really wrong with it.\n\n> Just when I learned this rule I found something that completely contradicts it\n\nThat explains English in a nutshell.\n\nAlthough I'm not sure your example is an affirmative sentence. It doesn't seem to be a response to a question. Also the continuous tense changes things.",
      "I don't think it's a useful \"rule\". I can immediately think of common expressions that contradict it.",
      "The problem with the \"clothes\" example is not that the sentence is affirmative, rather it's because \"clothes\" is uncountable and you can't use \"many\" with an uncountable noun. The example itself is correct but the reasoning is wrong. There's nothing inherently wrong with using \"many\" in an affirmative sentence.",
      "Unfortunately, colloquial English isn‚Äôt tightly rule driven. \n\n‚ÄúHave you got a lot of shoes?‚Äù, ‚ÄúSure, I have too many. Much of my shopping is online, and many times I just push the BUY button‚Äù.",
      "I wouldn't use \"many\" with \"clothes\". But I might use it with \"shoes,\" for example. \"My daughter has many shoes.\" \"There are many shoes near the door.\"\n\nI might also say \"a lot of\", though. In general, I don't think correct usage is as simple as that text would suggest.",
      "They're wrong. We do use \"a lot\" a lot, but you can certainly use many in an affirmative sentence like I have many books or I have many friends.\n\nWhat you can't do is use many as a partitive. For example, you can't say I have many milk or I have many stuff. You have to say I have a lot of milk\n Basically you can use it with plurals",
      "I‚Äôve definitely used ‚Äúmany‚Äù in affirmative sentences, but the more I think about it the more ‚Äúa lot‚Äù sounds more fitting. I think there‚Äôs a subconscious element of ‚Äúa lot‚Äù sounding a little more exaggerated, which often reinforces an affirmation. Sort of like saying ‚Äúdo‚Äù in an affirmative sentence. Both are correct for countable nouns.",

    "comments": [
      "The use of past perfect in the first clause isn't normally an error with '*after*', but because you gave the year (1985), it implies that the action that followed (relationship) was not in that year, because the past perfect indicates a completed period.\n\nActually, your grammatical error is in the second clause. You put the state of being in a relationship in **present continuous** (or **present progressive** in US English). We generally avoid using continuous verbs (be + verb-ing) with **states** (or **stative verbs**). It's better to say '*I had a relationship with her / I was in a relationship with her*'.",
      "[deleted]",
      "\"After I had met my girlfriend\" (with or without a specific time qualifier) implies that the action (meeting) was over and done with before what you go on to describe next. Strictly speaking, meeting someone *can* be a one-off thing, but it sounds jarringly disjointed if you're describing a long-term relationship with that same person, as if meeting her and forming a relationship with her were either entirely unrelated or discrete phases of a sequence. If you met her once at a party and then only became lovers three years later, you *could* use the past perfect, but even then it would sound more natural to stick to simple past for narrative flow and immediacy. \n\nContinuous tenses don't work well with stative verbs, or in any case where the 'action' (such as it is) is inherently ongoing by its very nature. We tend only to use \"was having\" or the like: \n(i) as part of set phrases that indicate a non-stative action (such as \"she was having toast for breakfast\" or \"he was having a heart attack\"); \n(ii) where there are repeated episodes in a single phenomenon (e.g. \"he was having problems with his telephone\" or \"she was having a nightmare of a day\"); or \n(iii) where you are establishing a routine, habit or propensity (e.g. \"as teenagers, they were going swimming two or three times a week\" or \"I was always stubbing my toe on the furniture\").",
      "Honestly before we even get to grammar, \"I was having a relationship with her\" is not something we ever say. You *had* a relationship or *were in* a relationship, but not *was having* a relationship.\n\nA lot of the time adding the \"had/have\" to the past tense 'sounds' excessive. For example: \"I had gone to the store before you had arrived\" sounds \"complicated\" or \"heavy\". There's nothing 'incorrect' about this and it doesn't sound bad, it just sounds excessively wordy. Saying \"I went to the store before you arrived\" communicates the same thing.\n\nThe way the AI corrected your sentence to \"after I met... I had a relationship\" sounds fine.\n\nI think it's more important to get the \"vibe\" of the tenses. The past perfect tense is used to say something finished and was done before something else in the past happened or started. Like the past perfect tense is telling you about an action or something that happened two steps back.\n\n* \"*I had begun to use swear words* \\[2 steps back\\] by the time I went to school \\[1 step back\\]\"\n* \"*The company had deleted the files* \\[2 steps back\\] before she started to look for them \\[1 step back\\]\"\n* \"*We had already eaten dessert* \\[2 steps back\\] when they arrived \\[1 step back\\]\"\n* \"The day *after the dog barfed up all the cake it had eaten* \\[2 steps back\\], the house began to stink \\[1 step back\\]\"\n\nIn thinking of example sentences to put here for the past perfect, I'm thinking of a lot of sentences with \"already\" and \"when\" and \"by the time\" and \"before\" sorts of words in them. These are all pieces that connect ideas in time order.\n\nAbout the \"was having a relationship\", this is a progressive tense indicated by the -ing. \n\nThere was a post on tenses a few weeks or month ago and the main point we talked about is that some of these more elaborate tenses are typically used to \"set the scene\" and be the background for another action to occur in front of.\n\nThe -ing tenses are very often a background action that is ongoing that something else is going to happen in front of as a discrete action.\n\n* \"I was dancing on the stage \\[setting the scene\\] when the light fell and hit me \\[action\\]\"\n* \"It was starting to rain \\[setting the scene\\] so I shut the window \\[action\\]\"\n* \"While shutting the window \\[setting the scene\\] I saw the car in the driveway \\[action\\]\"\n* \"I am writing this comment \\[setting the scene\\] and can hear the neighbor mowing his lawn \\[action\\]\"\n* \"I am going to need to mow mine as well \\[setting the scene\\] before it rains \\[action\\]\"",

You can also use these:  \n\\- \"My mistake.\" or \"My fault.\"  \n\\- \"Beg your pardon.\" (archaic or old way of talking)  \n\\- \"Whoops...\" (with an upward inflection and maybe stress the S for comedic effect)  \n\\- \"Well, that sucks...\" (comedic)  \n\\- A clever joke. My personal favorite: \"Well, my plan was calculated, but BOY am I bad at math.\"\n\nEdit: Formatting\n\nEdit2: Don't use the lower options if you are not at least on good terms with who you are talking to. My bad/mistake/fault is enough and no one expects more.",

    "comments": [
      "\"without so much as\" means \"without\", i.e. none at all. In fact, it indicates not only that there is no electricity, but also no better things than electricity. It means \"they came from a village that did not *even* have electricity\".\n\n\"without so much\" means \"without very much\", i.e. very little.",
      "> They came from a village without so much electricity.\n\nThis sentence is a bit odd, but it can be read as having basically the same meaning as: ‚ÄúThey came from a village without much electricity.‚Äù In fact, it sounds much more natural without the ‚Äúso.‚Äù Perhaps we‚Äôre talking about a village where most houses are not connected to a power grid. \n\nIf we‚Äôre making an implicit comparison, the ‚Äúso‚Äù is more natural:\n\n> [We have a lot of electricity.] They came from a village without so much (‚âà **as much**) electricity.\n\n‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî\n\n> They came from a village without so much as electricity.\n\nThis means: ‚ÄúThey came from a village that, surprisingly, had no electricity and none of the things that depend on it.‚Äù\n\n‚ÄúWithout so much as [a thing]‚Äù is a phrase that means ‚Äúwithout [a thing] that is expected‚Äù or ‚Äúwithout even [a thing].‚Äù\n\n> He disappeared without so much as a by-your-leave.\n>\n> He left without asking if it was okay[, but it was expected that he should have asked].\n\n> Then he stormed out without so much as a goodbye.\n>\n> He left without saying goodbye[, which was rude].\n\n> He escaped the accident without so much as a scratch.\n>\n> He escaped the accident without any injury[, which was surprising].",
      "\"Without so much as X\" means that they don't even have X (or don't do X, depending on the context). Another example:\n\n\"He arrived at school without so much as a pen.\" - He didn't even have a pen when he arrived at school.\n\n\"Without so much X\" means they do have X, but not a lot of it. So the first sentence means the village *does* have electricity, but not a lot of it, and the second sentence means the village doesn't even have electricity at all.",
      "\"Without so much\" carries an implication of scarcity (as in, we don't have a lot of it), while \"without so much as\" implies a complete lack of something (as in, we have none at all).",
      "\"They came from a village without so much electricity\" implies \"Their village had a little bit of electricity.\" This sounds awkward and I would not advise using it. It sounds like there is missing context. Maybe it would make more sense if you were just talking about another area that has a lot of electricity, and you are contrasting it to the village. It would be better to say \"They came from a village where access to electricity is hard to find.\"\n\n\"They came from a village without so much as electricity\" implies \"Their village did not have any electricity.\" This sounds very conversational and informal. Depending on the tone, it might even sound condescending. The wording \"so much as\" implies that it is shocking to imagine it. It's so crazy that their village didn't have electricity! If you didn't want that implication, you could just say \"They came from a village without electricity.\"",
      "it means that they came from a village that didn't even have electricity.  In other words, the village had nothing at all, not even electricity."

      "Grammar is necessary to learn in order to speak a language fluently; however, ‚Äúlearning‚Äù doesn‚Äôt have just one path and it doesn‚Äôt necessarily have to be active. You can passively learn (acquire) grammar (this is how native speakers learn), but for an adult learner, this isn‚Äôt very practical unless you‚Äôre spending a significant amount of time immersed in the language‚Äîand even then, it‚Äôs faster and easier to actively learn. \n\nIt takes native speakers years of constant input in critical stages of development to be able to produce a grammatically correct sentence.

You may understand the words spoken, but not comprehend the nuance, exact meaning, or be able to reproduce it organically yourself. \n\nIn short, if you‚Äôre struggling with grammar, as you mention you are, then yes, you should be putting in active effort to learn it‚Äîat least if your goal is fluent communication. That is the most efficient method. Passively trying to acquire it is unrealistic for almost all‚Äîif not all‚Äîpeople who are not very young.",
      "It depends what you mean by \"important\", and how much you intend to learn it.\n\nThe basics are necessary to be able to form sentences and be understood. If you make grammar mistakes, people might not understand you, or may misunderstand.\n\nIt's not at all essential to learn all the technical terms. About 90% of native English speakers wouldn't be able to tell you what a preposition is - they just use them, naturally.\n\nThe most effective way to learn English is by speaking it a lot, making lots of mistakes, and learning from them. *Focusing* on the \"rules\" can be counterproductive. Most \"rules\" have lots of exceptions, and there are often exceptions to the exceptions, so it can make you more confused than ever. Instead, you will eventually learn what \"sounds right\", and what doesn't - without being able to explain the technicalities.",

If you want to learn the language fully and be able to communicate well with native speakers it's extremely important, but if you don't need it enough to justify spending years on learning it then that's up to you.\n\n\nAs someone who studies the dead language of Old English and can't ever achieve fluency in it because no native speakers exist, I probably understand better than most why some people might want to be able to read a language more than speak it. Since Modern English isn't a dead language most people will assume if you want to learn English it's to speak it, but learning a language to fluency takes years and if you don't have a lot of use for it then fluency may not be right for you.",

If he goes to Australia or Canada to live there on the assumption it's better than staying in the UK, he has emigrated.\n\nIn recent years this has been complicated by a straw-man argument where left-wing people claim right-wing people think the distinction is skin colour (the right wing people don't actually do this) and therefore the right-wing people are evil. This causes a lot of confusion. It ignores the large number of south and southeast Asian expats in the Gulf states, and the large number of British emigrants... everywhere they can emigrate to. \n\nSo: the older and/or right-wing meaning is that an expat is temporarily abroad. The new and/or left-wing meaning is that an expat is a white Anglo-Saxon type.",

You can watch a tree grow, but not a knee, it's a nonsense sentence. The commentor is hoping the speaker will just stumble through the sentence before realizing it's a racist af attempt at a prank.\n\n(In the US, the word 'negro' and its derivatives was a very common, very derogatory term during the slave era; and once slavery ended it was used to harass and intimidate black people, sometimes even resulting in killing a black person. Racism could legally be enforced up until the 1960s, and this word was a major part of the 'social control' that racists would use to intimidate black people into doing \\[whatever\\], or punish them for imagined offenses. It even happened that black people would be murdered, sometimes for non-existent crimes, and \"no one knew who did it!\" because the racist (usually white) person or people were supported in \"teaching them n---rs a lesson!\" or something similar. Black people were literally murdered in order to intimidate the whole population, and enough people in the town/area supported it with the result that the murderer(s) would never go to court. To say the word was used to abuse is an understatement.\n\nIn most languages the word just relates to the color 'black' but in US English it's a word you really should not say out loud. It's one of the very few words that have been socially 'retired' because it's usage was so negative that we have simply stopped using it.\n\nYou occasionally hear two black men use the word for each other in a casual way,  but even that usage seems to be diminishing; but that is the only time you should ever hear the word in regular life.

      "1. Agreed but there is still some nuance here. A native speaker might break up a contraction for emphasis (\"No, I did *not*\" instead of \"No I didn't\") and it's common to avoid them in very formal writing.\n2. In casual conversation with someone you're familiar with this is true. Using these when you're trying to be polite like if you were speaking with a stranger or your superior might come off as rude. Because native speakers would absolutely say \"Can you please tell me...\" (or similar) in some situations.\n3. Is this just saying don't pause between words? Never heard it called linking but that's what it sounds like...which I guess is true, we tend to just flow from one word to the next in normal conversation.\n4. Not all these are filler phrases in that example...\"kind of\" and \"sort of\" are just descriptors you don't just say them as filler. \"Ya know\" is and to a lesser extent \"I mean\" is as well. But the overall point is correct, filler phrases and hesitation words like \"um\" \"uh\" and \"like\" are an important part of English.\n5. This is very true.

For example, in the US the federal government receives taxes and distributes part of that back to each state to help with operating schools. But each state sets their own curriculum, school calendars, each state has its own standards for certifying and disciplining teachers, and so on. There is the federal government, and the state governments, and neither has full control. The powers and responsibilities are separated.\n\nWhat Ramaswamy is trying to \"say\" is that he thinks the federal government in DC has too much power and that the states have too little, and in his opinion federalism (the division of responsibilities) has become too lopsided, and that if he is elected to be governor he will try to reclaim some of those state's powers that he thinks have been diluted or lost.\n\n(Note: whether he is correct on the facts is another matter, but this thread is not the place for that kind of argument; he is like many politicians in that he says a lot of things, but has only an intermittent relationship with facts - and in an opinion statement like this it is simply not possible to prove him fully right or fully wrong, and the ensuing argument would be very messy and require a lot of historical background)",

I'm not aware of the exact context so I don't know the specifics.\n\nThat feels different to me than your explanation - you weren't specific on what you meant by \"vote like Ohio votes\" but I default to reading that to mean \"vote like Ohio voters voted in an election\" as opposed to \"like the Ohio legislators voted on a bill in the state legislature\".  Of course, one of Vivek's goals probably is to promote the Republican party so you likely aren't wrong he wants that, but this is likely referring to a specific state bill that was just signed into law that he's touting as his and Ohio's achievement and calling other states to copy it.",

    "comments": [
      "In every day usage, you can climb up, down, or even side to side. However, if you leave off the \"up,\" people will usually assume you're climbing up (as in \"to climb a ladder\").\n\nIn an airplane, climbing only refers to going up in elevation, so the \"up\" isn't necessary.",
      "‚ÄúClimb‚Äù by itself is more general. ‚ÄúClimb up‚Äù is specifically climbing *up*. \n\nI‚Äôm not sure I understand the second question, but I‚Äôll try to answer it anyway. If you said that an aircraft was climbing, I would interpret that as the aircraft is steadily flying higher. Saying ‚Äúthe aircraft was climbing up‚Äù sounds off to me and I would never say it. The only thing I might add is an altitude, for example ‚Äúthe aircraft climbed to 20,000 feet‚Äù or something like that.",
      "They are pretty much interchangeable. Climb the stairs, climb up the stairs. Both are correct.\n\nIf there is no object and the usage is simply 'Ciimb.' it just means 'go higher'\n\n'The plane/temperature/volume climbs'",
      "I don't think there's much difference in meaning. Possibly there is some difference in register with 'climb' sounding a little more formal and 'climb up' a little less so and more day-to-day, but it's a very subtle difference. Newsreaders would probably use 'climb'. \n\nIf I try out sentences in my head then my brain definitely wants to add 'up' to 'the monkey climbs to its branch in the tree' but the biggest thing that 'up' changes if I add it isn't meaning or register but where the sentence stress falls. If I don't add 'up', then 'climbs' carries a lot more stress. If I instead say 'the monkey climbs up to its branch in the tree' the stress falls clearly on 'up' and the sentence (in my opinion) seems to flow better and feels nicer to say.\n\nUsing 'up' or not after 'climb' isn't ever something I would consciously think about, so  my guess is that there isn't a significant difference but rather one of quite subtle differences in style, accent and ease of pronunciation.  \n\nThinking about your example, I can say either 'the pilot climbed to 20000 feet' or 'the pilot climbed up to 20000 feet'' and the meaning is clear and identical in both. However if I use 'up' I am (slightly) expecting a second clause to follow, again I think because of how the rhythm and stress falls. But adding a second clause wouldn't be wrong without 'up' and likewise it wouldn't be wrong to not have a second clause if you use 'up'. These are subtle feelings. \n\nIn general terms, when you get a long answer like this and native speakers aren't immediately sure without having to think hard about exactly how they use a word then the answer is often  'style'. And especially so when the opinions vary, as style and register are extremely variable between different English dialects.\n\nTl;dr: either 'climb' or 'climb up' are fine to use based on your personal preference.",
      "Climb and climb up are essentially two ways to mean the same thing. Climb and climb up both mean to increase elevation. So someone may want to climb up a ladder or climb a ladder to go up to somewhere higher than where they are currently positioned at.",
      "OK, this is my impression, as a native English speaker in the US:\n\nAn airplane climbs to achieve its altitude. People can climb a tree, climb a ladder, and so on. Usually, when I think climb up I'm thinking of stepping on something and alternating feet to step or proceed upward. We \"climb up into the attic\" by pulling down the folding stairs tucked up into the ceiling. Then we climb that ladder. Or we climb up that ladder. Hell, it really doesn't matter",
      "In normal conversation, I‚Äôd say there‚Äôs not much of a distinction between ‚Äúclimb‚Äù and ‚Äúclimb up‚Äù. Perhaps with ‚Äúclimb‚Äù there‚Äôs a bit of ambiguity on direction as you could be climbing horizontally as opposed to the singular verticality of ‚Äúclimb up‚Äù.\n\nWith aircraft, I know that the word ‚Äúclimb‚Äù is used to describe the action of a plane pitching up and gaining elevation. I am unsure if ‚Äúclimb up‚Äù is used at all in aviation terms specifically.",
      "Yeah nail on the head. I feel most people would use ‚Äúascend‚Äù and ‚Äúdescend‚Äù for aircraft anyway though",
      "You‚Äôre right, yeah, ascend and descend are the words I‚Äôd expect to hear in a sentence with aircraft. I imagine more technical sounding words are usually used together"

Even more rarely, you'll also hear \"clicking \\[one's\\] tongue\" to describe a wordless command to a dog.  My favorite example is from the 1988 movie *The Accidental Tourist*.  Geena Davis plays a dog trainer with a world-class tongue click.\n\nBoth expressions refer to a noise made with the tongue, not a facial expression.\n\nCongratulations, by the way, on the sophistication of your English: not a lot of native speakers routinely run into either of these expressions, as they are no longer in common use.

    "text": "# 1Ô∏è‚É£ Introduction: The Strange Politeness of \"Did You Want a Coffee?\"\n\n*\"Did you want a coffee?\"* ‚Äî at first glance, this question looks odd.  \nThe person is asking now, but the verb is in the past tense. Why?\n\nIn English, this form of polite question is very common, especially in places like caf√©s, restaurants, and casual conversations.  \nBut why does using a past tense sound polite?  \nAnd why do so many explanations about this seem unsatisfying?\n\nIn this post, I will examine the logic behind this phenomenon and show why the past tense works as an effective politeness strategy.\n\n*Note: For those interested in a more detailed, linguistically focused version of this topic (including cross-linguistic comparisons), a companion post will be available soon.*\n\n# 2Ô∏è‚É£ The Usual Explanations ‚Äî And Their Problems\n\nEnglish learners are often told that the past tense here \"**creates psychological distance**,\" making the request sound softer.  \nOr they hear that \"**the past tense here doesn't mean past time**\" ‚Äî it's just a politeness marker.\n\nBut these explanations have serious flaws:\n\n* They suggest that \"**time and politeness**\" are completely unrelated, which is misleading.\n* They often fail to explain why \"**could**\" and \"**would**\" actually feel more polite than \"**can**\" and \"**will**\".\n* They don't account for why \"**Did you want...?**\" is preferred in certain contexts but sounds strange in others.\n\nClearly, there's more going on.\n\n# 3Ô∏è‚É£ A Better Explanation: Temporal Framing and Cognitive Pacing\n\nHere's a more useful way to understand this phenomenon.\n\nWhen we use *Did you want...?* or *Would you...?*, we are not simply being indirect.  \nWe are subtly shaping the **temporal frame** of the interaction.\n\nBy putting the question in the past tense, the speaker does two things:\n\n1Ô∏è‚É£ Signals that the request is **not sudden** ‚Äî it may have been thought about or assumed earlier.  \n2Ô∏è‚É£ Gives the listener **time to consider their response** ‚Äî they don't feel immediate pressure.\n\nThis is related to **cognitive pacing**:  \nA well-paced question gives the other person **mental space** to reflect, which increases comfort and politeness.\n\n# 4Ô∏è‚É£ Real-life Examples\n\nCompare:\n\n* *Will you have a coffee?* ‚Üí sounds like a request **right now**, can feel pushy.\n* *Would you like a coffee?* ‚Üí softer, gives more time to think.\n* *Did you want a coffee?* ‚Üí adds another layer ‚Äî suggests that perhaps the listener had already been considering this, reducing pressure even further.\n\nIn real conversations, this subtle shift makes a big difference.  \nIt also allows for **easy rejection** without awkwardness:\n\n*\"No, I didn't.\"* ‚Üí socially smooth.  \n*\"No, I don't.\"* ‚Üí feels more abrupt.\n\n# 5Ô∏è‚É£ Cross-cultural Perspective\n\nOther languages handle this politeness-time relationship differently.\n\n* Korean and Japanese often use **sentence pacing and phrase delaying** rather than tense shifts.\n* Spanish and Italian sometimes use **conditional forms**.\n* In English, **past tense framing** is a highly effective and well-accepted strategy.\n\nThis shows that **politeness and time framing are deeply connected**, but each language implements this differently.\n\n# 6Ô∏è‚É£ Common Misunderstandings to Avoid\n\n* \"**The past tense here has nothing to do with time**\" ‚Üí False. It does ‚Äî it frames the **social time** of the request.\n* \"**It's just psychological distance**\" ‚Üí Too vague. The more precise effect is about **temporal pacing and response management**.\n* \"**You must always use it**\" ‚Üí No. Context matters. In formal situations, *Would you...?* is often better. With friends, *Do you want...?* may be perfectly fine.\n\n# 7Ô∏è‚É£ Conclusion\n\nWhen used well, *Did you want...?* is not an odd grammatical error ‚Äî it's a **powerful tool** for managing politeness and social flow.\n\nIt works because it:\n\n* Frames the request in a **non-immediate temporal space**.\n* Gives the listener **processing time**.\n* Provides an **easy out** if they wish to decline.\n\nIn other words:  \nIt uses **temporal framing** to create **social comfort** ‚Äî which is one of the core functions of politeness itself.\n\n\n\n*Note: I am not a linguist nor an expert in English education. The following analysis reflects an independent reasoning process based on publicly observable usage and cognitive principles. Given that similar ideas may have been explored elsewhere, this post does not claim originality but aims to contribute to the ongoing discussion in a transparent manner.

Or more precisely, it has many terms (and none of them are specific).\n\nIt means \"with more, or extras\", but in order to know what those extras are you have to refer to the current offer.\n\n\"Loaded pepperoni\" could mean 2x the normal pepperoni, but it could also mean the normal amount but extra cheese. Or it could mean pepperoni with vegetables. Or it could mean pepperoni is *under* the cheese in addition to being on top. Or...\n\nIt means whatever the advertising manager and the company's \"test chef\" came up with that month, and the advertisement is what will tell you what the current definition is.\n\nIt has the potential to confusing because if you go to Pizza Hut and order \"loaded pepperoni\" you'll get the deal being offered. Then if you go to Dominos and order it, you'll get something else, and if you go to Pudge Bros. they might not have any idea what you're talking about; in the last example they would ask you to explain what it is you want as a recipe so they could prepare it.",

Pulling your cheeks back helps position your tongue to make a rhotic R sound.\n\nLs are similar, just switch the phrase to \"lovely ladies.\" Make sure that you stretch the tip of your tongue to the ridge behind your teeth, but keep that big smile.\n\nThe primary focus of these exercises is to get you familiar with the consonants, so your vowels will sound kind of weird and stretched. That's okay. Start slowly, focusing on the position of your tongue. Speed up as you get more comfortable.

It can have questions like \"John does \\*what\\*?\" or \"is that 'he' referring to some other guy, or to John?\"",
      "I would be more specific in both cases but that‚Äôs because we have no context.\n\na. Depending on meaning: John is all bark and no bite. or John talks more than he works.\n\nb.

      "The formulation in a is a garden path sentence, which is something that follows all the grammatical rules but is very confusing to the listener. I would be quite surprised it you had ended the sentence already before capping \"does\" with another verb. B is more easily understood, but I don't really like it. I don't often see \"does\" just left on its own like that. I would probably use one of the several proverbial cliches to suggest John is all bark and no bite, or vice versa.",

      "I guess it would depend on context, but my assumption with option A is that you're comparing John to another unnamed person - \"John talks more than \\[that other dude\\] does.\" I would guess option B means John is [all bark and no bite](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/all_bark_and_no_bite).",
      "Depends on the context.",
      "Both are theoretically possible but very awkward, because English speakers prefer to interpret DO as a pro-verb (replacing another verb) where possible. The meaning ‚Äúaccomplish‚Äù, as in DO SOMETHING, is secondary. So we would rather use another verb, like ‚Äúwork‚Äù, in this context.\n\n‚ÄúJohn talks more than he does‚Äù, with the stress on ‚Äúdoes‚Äù, is kind of natural. ‚ÄúJohn does more than he talks‚Äù sounds *really* weird because the beginning of the sentence sets up DO as a full verb, which is transitive unlike TALK - then you read DO MORE as a transitive verb + object, which leads to a classic garden path sentence. You could say ‚ÄúJohn prefers doing to talking‚Äù to neutralise the verb and that would be more sensible. But this is such a fine point of English grammar that I‚Äôd try to avoid using DO in this context.",
      "I think I know what you are trying to say... but \"do\" isn't the right verb for it. \"Act\" is better. \n\nJohn talks more than he acts. \n\nIt means that John makes a lot of plans and tells people about those plans, but he rarely sets those plans into action.\n\nYour original sentence can make sense with context, but it is still ambiguous. \n\nA: Look at George talking over there. \n\nB: Yeah... but do you know John? John talks more than he does.\n\nIn this case, \"he\" refers to George, but it is still ambiguous because technically it can refer to John. \n\nSo the tl;dr is the \"than he/she does\" pattern is used to compare one person to another. For two actions within a single person, you should say what the other action is instead of the generic \"do.\"",
      "Yes, they both work. At first, it's not obvious what these are supposed to exactly mean without extra context, but I assume they are both the same context but with opposite meanings.",
      "John talks more than he does. He does what? it's not a 'proper' sentence, it's fully understandable but not 100% grammatical. John talks more than he talks or John does talk more than he talks or John talks more than (name) does talk. talks and does talk are almost interchangeable. to talk -> do talk -> does talk. he does talk -> he talks. instead of do becoming do(e)s talk becomes talks.",

    "text": "In my native language Dutch we got separate words for sailing with a ship that has real sails and uses only the wind to go forward (zeilen much like the English to sail), and a verb used for to go forward in a boat in general (varen) but that's also translated with to sail.\n\nSo, if I got my motorboat, and go towards a certain place, the motorboat is 'sailing' to .... ?\n\nThere really is no separate word for this? Sailing is what you would commonly also use for ships that have no sails whatsoever? To me that seems kind of odd. ",
    "comments": [
      "Just be careful about using motorboat as a verb. It can mean, um, a different kind of activity.",
      "In English, *to sail* is often used to refer to the purposeful movement of a ship or boat regardless of its means of propulsion. So it would be reasonable for me to say that my father-in-law sailed all over the Pacific when he was in the navy, even though his ship was nuclear-powered. Or that the ferry has a sailing time of 10:30 am, even though the ferry isn't a sailing vessel.\n\nBut you can also use some terms based on the means of propulsion: a steamship *steams*, a sailboat *sails*, a motorboat *motors*. This can be quite significant when a vessel has multiple means of propulsion, such as a sailing yacht that also has a motor.",
      "I would say 'boating'! Sailing is for ships with sails, boating is for ships with motors, rowing is for using oars. But if someone described a large cargo ship with engines as 'sailing' to another country, it wouldn't sound weird. I typically hear boating with small ships.\n\nETA: For instance, in the state of California, operating any recreational motorized vehicle requires a boater card.",
      "Correct. But it‚Äôs fuzzy. \n\nFor private pleasure boats we normally say we‚Äôre going out on Dave‚Äôs boat, or going boating, and if Dave‚Äôs boat is a sailboat then we‚Äôre going sailing with Dave. For small vessels that still might be sail powered, that distinction exists. \n\nBut if you‚Äôre going out on a giant diesel powered cruise ship? Yeah we can still say we set sail on Thursday. Even though zero actual sails are set. The crew on a boat or ship are still called sailors. And diesel powered cargo ships sail across the ocean. We still say that, even though they haven‚Äôt been sail powered for well over a century. \n\nWe say sailing for powered boats the same way we say filming for video recording, or taping for audio recording. There are new words but we keep using the old ones. So if you‚Äôre actually sailing with wind power you sometimes need to use extra words to explain that.",
      "For a small motorboat, I would use either \"drive the boat\" or \"take the boat.\" \"Boating\" to me implies a leisure activity.\n\nIn terms of describing the skill, I would use drive. \"Can you drive a boat?\" \"I'm teaching him to drive the boat.\" \n\nDay to day use, I think I would use \"take.\" \"I'm taking the boat to the island this afternoon.\" \"I'll take you out on the boat to show you the best fishing spots.\" Occasionally I might say drive as well. \"Jason Statham drove the boat right between two gondolas.\"",
      "It is a bit odd to use sail without sails, but there aren‚Äôt that many options.\n\nYou can use *cruise* for some meanings of varen/vaart (both verb and noun).",
      "Well, there's a lot to unpack here.\n\nThe voyage itself is always sailing. \"The ship turned on its engines and sailed to its distant destination.\"\n\nHow the ship moves will be referred to with the method: sailing, rowing, or motoring. \"The small boat rowed across the pond.\" \"The ferry motored its way across the harbor.\" \"The sailboat sailed up and down the beach.\"\n\nThen there is the operation of said boat. That can vary wildly based on the size and type of ship. You aren't the \"driver\" of a giant cargo ship, you are a \"helmsman.\" Things like that.",
      "I've always driven motorboats and sailed sailboats. And rowed a rowboat, but I try to avoid that. That's in the US.¬†\n\n\nI've occasionally heard people talking about sailing a motorboat, but not usually from someone who actually spends time on boats.¬†",
      "There is no specific word for traveling to a place in a water vehicle which does not have sails. It's still sailing. A crew member on a ship (any ship) is still a sailor.",
      "BrEng - there's not really a direct translation for 'varen', and if someone said \"I'm sailing to Hoek van Holland from Harwich\" then I'd assume that they were taking the ferry or another type of powered craft, not getting into a sailing boat! It's probably more common to say \"I'm _taking_ the ferry\" (equivalent to \"ik ga met de veerboot\") or \"I'm going on a speedboat\" as a phrase. \nWe also use the phrase \"to set sail\" to mean 'to get a boat journey underway' (is there a similar phrase in Dutch?)",
      "There used to be comparable words in English. Terms like ‚Äúmotoring‚Äù, ‚Äúcruising‚Äù, and ‚Äústeaming‚Äù all were used like you are describing. Today though, so few people are familiar with any kind of maritime activities, that yeah ‚Äúsailing‚Äù is pretty much a catch-all term. \n\nAlso, keep in mind that the Netherlands are culturally really really intense when it comes to boats.",
      "I have sailed a sailboat, paddled a kayak and a canoe, and driven a powerboat. Looking forward to being back on the water next week.",

      "For a big sailboat that has a motor and sales and uses the motor only rarely I would say that it is \"motoring\" into its slip if it were going there without its sail power.",

And you just cannot delete the previous word like in writing.\n\nI put listening at last because like speaking you have less time to process, but unlike speaking you have no control of the content being said. Reading and listening are both ‚Äúreception‚Äù, but unlike reading, words are connected in natural conversations.

Therefore, that thing must be a bird.\n\nThat is an assumption made *a priori* (a deduction or conclusion drawn from information I already knew prior to this moment, rather than a conclusion I developed by trying to find out whether birds are truly the only things that fly).\n\nThe term is used in philosophy and law, academics, etc. in order to help someone identify the reason one idea is weak or another idea is strong. If I published a research article about thousands of birds in my garden, and cited my experience as described above, another scientist (or lawyer, etc) would publish a counter-argument pointing out that insects fly, airplanes fly, and so on. And that while I saw things flying, my statement (that there are thousands of birds at my house) has insufficient information, and that I forgot to explain why *only* birds and not other possibilities should be considered as a valid observation.\n\nThey would make me go back and examine a percentage of the flying things, noting the material and size, the habit or movement, and other details which could contribute to \"proving\" that I had thousands of birds at my house rather than thousands of insects or thousands of airplanes; and that most likely I was seeing thousands of *insects* because they are small, and thousands *could* fit on my property while birds and airplanes are quite large, and would probably *not* fit on my property unless I owned an entire estate.\n\nIn other words, they would point out that I made an *a priori* assumption (based on prior experience) but in order to prove my point, I need to provide *a posteriori* discussion. *Posteriori* meaning something like \"information collected in addition to what is already known\". They might give me some guides to airplanes, birds, and insects, and ask me to find images of the things flying around my property. Maybe I need to capture one, or sketch an image (or take a video). Maybe I watch for them to drop something, and I go pick up the dropped object and include it with my report. Did the things drop feathers? Or scales? Or metal bits?\n\n  \nAnyway. The examples in your screenshots do have some limited relationship to the phrase but they use the phrase incorrectly, which is probably the reason for your confusion.",
      "It essetnially means \"(given) information that is already known\".\n\n\"I'm beyond that. A priori.\"  -> it is already known\n\nThe consequence of the a priori dismissal of the native population... here the \"a priori\" information is mere fact of them being native population. They didn't have any regard for the current facts of the situation or the anticipated future.\n\nNo nations or actors are viewed, a priori, as good or bad. Meaning we don't decide whether nations are presently good or bad just because of what has come before. We don't go into analyzing a conflict, for example, by first deciding which ones were the good guys.",

And as such it is generally how the general public would use it so it's still important at least know why they're using it.\n\nHowever the first two paragraphs it appears to be just nonsense.  \nIn the first it seems from the context that what the author intended to convey is something more like inconsequential, or trivial, or \"matter of fact\".  Definitely not any reasonable interpretation of a priori.\n\nIn the second it appears to try to suggest \"transcendent\" or something.  Also nonsense.",
      "I was going to say that both of those examples in OP are pretentious at the very least. That's not how I'd use *a priori*.\n\nIt is used when a statement can be deduced by reason alone. I would argue whether the 'dismissal of the native population was genocide' *was* deducible by reason alone. And in the second example, knowing that 'nations or actors' are the 'bad guys' is definitely *not* deducible by reason alone.\n\nBoth propositions in OP require knowledge, experience, and opinion - and the latter means they are not absolute anyway.",

I read it as close as \"assumed to be true through pure reason, without experience or evidence\". Because the writer is a native speaker, writing the book in english, and it's not a piece of literature but a history journalism book which I really want to believe there's no way a journalist would use 'a priori' irresponsibly or just to be pretentious.",

One where you look up every word you don't know and add it to your flash cards, and a second where you just accept that you're going to miss words.\n\n\nIf you're not mining unknown word to put into a spaced repetition flash card deck (Anki) then the first one isn't worth doing IMO. You'll learn your target language much slower though.\n\n\nI highly recommend watching YouTube videos about language learning, specifically Japanese as those are the most popular and well made resources.",

I don't know man, I can understand a lot but this just sounds fucking stupid to me.",
      "Hey everyone! üëã\n\nSo I've been struggling with a common problem: I can read English subtitles perfectly, but when I turn them off, I miss half of what's being said. Reading text and understanding spoken English are completely different skills - your brain gets used to processing words visually instead of training your ears.\n\n**What I built:** A Chrome extension that adds a floating mic button to YouTube videos. When you miss something while listening (no subtitles), you can ask \"what did they just say?\" or \"what does that word mean?\" and get instant voice responses based on the video context.\n\nI tested it watching The Big Bang Theory without subtitles and it actually worked great - like having a language tutor next to you who can rewind and explain things.\n\n**The goal:** Train your ears to understand spoken English, not just your eyes to read text. Pure listening + AI help when you're stuck = faster progress toward real comprehension.\n\n**Thought this might help other English learners too?** Would love feedback on whether this approach makes sense.\n\nThe extension is free, but you'll need your own OpenAI API key (about $0.007 per question).\n\nGitHub: [https://github.com/SkyJinXX/WatchBuddy](https://github.com/SkyJinXX/WatchBuddy)\n\nWould love to hear your thoughts!",
      "Thanks for mentioning Yomitan! I might not have explained clearly - WatchBuddy is different from dictionary tools. It's more like having an AI conversation about real-time video content - you can ask \"what did they just say?\" or \"explain that concept\" and it understands the video context and timing.\n\nDifferent tools for different needs! üòä",
      "I think there's a misunderstanding. Reading subtitles and understanding spoken dialogue are completely different skills.\n\nWhen you rely on reading, your brain gets used to processing text instead of training your ear to catch the actual sounds, rhythm, and pronunciation. Pure listening forces you to develop real auditory comprehension.\n\nTry watching something without subtitles for a bit and you'll feel the difference.\n\nDifferent methods work for different people though! ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è"

This is something that I do with my students and has shown good results. \n\nAs for the dictionaries, you can follow the Oxford Advanced Learner's Dictionary among other apps which commonly come with images and examples. \n\nFor the accent part, I would ask you to focus on neutralizing your Indian accent rather than learning a new one.

If someone loses a football game you could say 'they were in poor form' or a highly successful team could be 'on top form'. \"rare form\" just means \"more successful than they usually are.\"",
      "A bit that no one else has mentioned is how this might apply to social situations, rather than the more direct sporting usage.\n\nIf someone is described as being in good form, it can mean they are generally doing well, cheerful and upbeat. I‚Äôd also expect it to imply good company.\n\nSo if I saw a friend and they were in rare form, I‚Äôd expect them to be happy, possibly excited, probably talkative, cracking (good) jokes, engaging company, maybe the life and soul of the party.",
      "To be \"in rare form\" means you're acting in a way that is uncharacteristic of yourself. I usually hear it used in a negative way to say \"this person isn't usually an asshole, but he is being one right now,\" but it can also be a good thing.",

More idiomatically, I think I‚Äôd be reaching for ‚Äòhe got out of bed on the wrong side‚Äô, ‚Äòhe was like a bear with a sore head,‚Äô ‚Äòwho pissed in his cereal?‚Äô, or just ‚Äòhe was being an asshole‚Äô.",

The dopamine hits are real, but am I really getting better? I don't think so.\n\nDon‚Äôt get me wrong, it‚Äôs fun and probably great for total beginners. But as someone who‚Äôs more intermediate now, I‚Äôm starting to feel like it‚Äôs not really helping me move toward fluency.\n\nI‚Äôve been digging through language subreddits and saw many recommending [italki ](https://go.italki.com/rtsgeneral6)for real language learning, especially if you want to actually speak and get fluent.\n\nI started using it recently and it‚Äôs insane how different it is. Just 1-2 sessions a week with a tutor pushed me to speak, make mistakes, and actually improve. I couldn‚Äôt hide behind multiple choice anymore. Having to speak face-to-face (even virtually) made a huge difference for me and I‚Äôm already feeling more confident.\n\nAnyone else go through something like this?\n\nIs Duolingo a good way to actually learn a language or just a fun little distraction that deludes us into thinking we're learning?",

      "Duolingo, as you point out, IS a game. But it's not just an illusion of learning. It is still a tool for learning, albeit not a very good one. I think the problem comes down to a disconnect in expectations. Duolingo is not going to make anyone fluent in any language, but a lot of people seem to think it is. And don't get me wrong, Duolingo encourages that belief, or at least doesn't do much of anything to discourage it. But I personally will always defend Duolingo, and I firmly believe it is a net-positive. If someone is serious about language learning, they may start with Duolingo but eventually they'll have the same realization that you're having now, and move on to better methods. And if they're not serious about language learning, the alternative is probably some other shovelware game on their phone that doesn't teach them anything. I know from my own experience that my mother-in-law used to spend hours playing Candy Crush, and now she spends that time playing French Duolingo. She still doesn't speak much French, but she definitely wasn't learning anything from Candy Crush. I think what's indisputable is that Duolingo has made a lot more people interested in learning languages who may not have been otherwise, and for that reason I think it's wonderful.",
      "I have a streak of over 5 years in Duolingo now. I would never use it expecting to reach fluency from it, but I think it helps to keep slightly warm languages you have to put on the backburner. I occasionally learn something new, often forget it, but it's a starting point.\n\n\nI think that much depends also on how close your target language is to languages you already speak. Like, learning Chinese from scratch as someone who speaks only English is one thing, keeping Dutch warm as someone who speaks German is another.",
      "It's an okay way to dip your toes into learning a new language, or to supplement learning, but anyone who thinks they are truly learning a language by just doing Duolingo is deluding themselves, yes.\n\nI have tried it  a few times in the past as a way to introduce myself to a language, before actually devoting more time and effort into learning it properly. Personally I find it gets tedious as hell after a week or two and I don't know how anyone finds it engaging enough to actually completely the tree or whatever it's called - I consider that a huge waste of time.\n\n(also, I think they are ethically reprehensible as a company and would never support them again, so there's that)",
      "Duolingo is definitely learning. It‚Äôs not learning how to actually speak a language, but if you do make the jump to trying to speak, the exposure from duo will help.",
      "Its a tool like any other.  It works.  I use it before I travel and during the trip.  My vocabulary and conversations are noticeably better as my trip goes on and keeping the target language in my head works - at least for me.\n\n  \nJust practicing on the program in a language vacuum without the extra fluency gained from interacting with people is probably limited in it's usefulness but it depends on your goals.  For me the #1 goal is conversational fluency - not written or near correct grammar.",
      "It's a game. That's all.",
      "I think it‚Äôs not just about completing the daily tasks which will help you improve but more real life conversations.",
      "I think it's good in the beginning and especially when you are unsure about learning the language. Switching to grammar books and actual content helps you reach fluency",
      "You still have to be brave enough to put yourself out there and speak it. I live in Dallas so I'm learning Spanish. I'm able to talk to Spanish-only speakers now, and I understand better what Spanish DJs say on the radio. Duo is a tool but it can't do it all for you. Practice, practice, practice.",
      "If we get past all the personal feeling about their promotion and gamification functionality, Duolingo is a very good product. But it is important to have realistic expectations.\n\nThere is active and passive learnings. Active learning happens in class, learning rules and making intentional things to get knowledge. It is crucial and important part of learning. And teachers also emphasise that off-class drills and repetition is as important. Because person cannot learn a language taking 2 classes a day.\n\nConsistent and repetitive exposure to language is as if not more important. This is where Duolingo steps is. It is a great app for exposure, drills and repetition. Its limitations are that one can develop a language with it up to A2 level and maintain B1-B2 level if needed. If you expect that Duolingo will help support your development to A2 and maintain your B1-B2, it's a great product.\n\nOne crucial thing about all apps, not only Duolingo is that you learn language to communicate with humans. No app and nothing except communication with humans can help you learn to communicate with humans. It is not reasonable to expect that from an app.",
      "I haven't used DL in years so take this with a grain of salt, it's based on my experience with it when I was early in my Spanish learning journey over a decade ago:\n\nDuoLingo is a good learning tool, but NOT on its own. You NEED to supplement it with other things like studying vocab and grammar rules directly, focused media consumption in target language, and conversation practice with real people whenever and wherever you can get it.",
      "Different platform has different target audiences. Duolingo targets beginners. So it works for beginners. If you use Duolingo and expect to reach a high level, then it‚Äôs on you that you picked the wrong tool. There are many other platforms targeting intermediate or advanced learners.",
      "It's better to just read a book",
      "Apps are good for building habits, but are not good for learning language.\n\n\nThe only thing that you have to do to learn a language is spaced repetition flash cards and watch shows/read books/play games in the language you want.",
      "Learning, yes, but some skills require more action. \n\nThink about it, do you really learn to drive just by watching YouTube videos? \n\nTo learn to drive you need to drive."

      "‚ÄúObligingly‚Äù is the adverb form of the verb ‚Äúoblige,‚Äù or ‚Äúobliging‚Äù. ‚ÄúOblige‚Äù just means to do what someone wants you to do.\n\nHe is obliging by yawning after being told to sleep.",
      "I think this may be translated into English, making it not as natural sounding as it may be in its original language. \n\nFor me, a better use of ‚Äúobligingly‚Äù would be: \n\n‚ÄúGet out of my way,‚Äù he said. \n\nShe stepped aside, obligingly.\n\nSo the second person is doing what the first person wanted them to so (step aside).",
      "He's \"obliging\" the sleep suggestion made by Zhang Yuwen by yawning, indicating sleepiness. To \"oblige\" in this sense is to do or experience something which agrees with some recently-mentioned expectation or another. Two examples:  \n  \nExample 1: \"I wish I hadn't dropped my sandwich,\" Karen said. \"I'm starving.\"   \nObligingly, Steve offered her half of his own.   \n(Note the fact that there was not a real, legal-or-otherwise obligation to do anything in this situation and it's just about \"being obliging\" which is another way of describing behaving empathetically).\n\nExample 2: \"How many kids do you have again? Is it two?\" I asked just before her two children walked obligingly down the stairs.  \n(Again, there was no direct obligation on the kids to do anything - in this case it just described a situation which happened serendipitously, which is to say \"fittingly\" or \"luckily\" for that moment.)\n\nSo it's not really about an existing obligation; it's really just meant to indicate that something just said, or asked, or which is otherwise somehow recently relevant, has been answered or addressed in a way suited to the question/comment. I hope that helps.",
      "It means to do something in agreement to what is being asked. So in this context the yawn is agreeing to the fact that they do indeed need some sleep",

      "interesting point, it does sound a little better that way now that i think about it, thanks!",
      "The yawn is corroborating the assertion that he's tired, that's why is obliging. Although this is a translation, I assume the original harem novel is in mandarin.¬†",

    "comments": [
      "So, to give an answer one step beyond ‚Äúbecause‚Äù- modern English has -s in 3rd person singular because older versions of English had -eth (he runneth, thus sayeth the Lord, etc.) and this has had a phoneme shift to -s. Meanwhile the second person singular -est  (thou makest, thou thinkest, etc.) just got dropped entirely, as English now uses the ‚Äúyou‚Äù form ( which was previously just plural/formal) for everything.",
      "Because that's the conjugation. Other languages have more complicated conjugation schemes, and some languages have multiple independent schemes.",
      "A verb like \"to steal\" used to be conjugated: ic \\[I\\] *stel****e***, √æ≈´ \\[thou\\] *stil****st***, hƒì/hƒìo/hit \\[he/she/it\\] *stil****√æ*** ... with different endings (!), but the \"√æ≈´/thou\" form got (mostly) dropped, and the other forms just became \"steal\".\n\n\"Stil√æ\", on the other hand, evolved to \"stealeth\" and finally to \"steals\".\n\nThere are lots of dialects of English today that leave off this \"-s\", and have different ways of conjugating and showing tense, so who knows what the future holds for English in general.",
      "It‚Äôs a vestigial component of what used to be a complex system of verb morphology. \n\n**Old English**\n\n|Infinitive|tacan (\"[to] take\")|\n:--|:--|\n|First-person singular (‚âà I)|tace|\n|Second-person singular (‚âà Thou)|t√¶cst|\n|Third-person singular (‚âà He/She/It)|t√¶c√æ|\n|Plural (‚âà We/You/They)|taca√æ|\n\n**Middle English**\n\n|Infinitive|taken (\"[to] take\")|\n:--|:--|\n|First-person singular (‚âà I)|take|\n|Second-person singular (‚âà Thou)|takest|\n|Third-person singular (‚âà He/She/It)|taketh|\n|Plural (‚âà We/You/They)|take **or** taken|\n\n**Modern English**\n\n|Infinitive|[to] take|\n:--|:--|\n|First-person singular (‚âà I)|take|\n|Second-person singular (‚âà Thou)|[replaced by formerly plural ‚Äúyou‚Äù]|\n|Third-person singular (‚âà He/She/It)|takes|\n|Plural (‚âà We/You/They)|take|\n\nEnglish, as part of a common trend in Western and Northern European languages, has become increasingly **analytic** over the centuries, which means we depend less on changing the form of words to mark grammatical relationships and instead rely on word order and function words. English (plus the Scandinavian languages) kind of stands at the ‚Äúvanguard‚Äù of this change, in part due to the way English has interacted with the languages around it (esp. Scandinavian and Celtic languages and French).\n\nThe ‚Äú-s‚Äù will probably disappear as well. It already has in some colloquial dialects.",

Compare the modern phenomena of [th-stopping](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Th-stopping) (‚Äúbrother‚Äù -> ‚Äúbrudder‚Äù) and [th-fronting](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Th-fronting) (‚Äúbrother‚Äù -> ‚Äúbruvver‚Äù).\n\nOld High German had already developed its modern ending in *lub≈çt* (= loves) and had lost /Œ∏/ altogether by 900 CE in favor of /d/ and /t/.\n\nThe English case is more complex. It could be mere simplification, especially in consonant clusters and then by analogy throughout the whole system, but this is problematic because that change is reflected nowhere else in English grammar, which retains /Œ∏/ in complex consonant clusters (e.g. ‚Äústrengths,‚Äù ‚Äúfifths‚Äù). \n\nA more coherent but roundabout hypothesis posits that it‚Äôs due to migration from Northern Germanic-speaking populations (which, for example, also introduced the pronoun ‚Äúthey‚Äù). Because the second- and third-person singular verb forms are/were identical in their language(s), it‚Äôs thought that they may have generalized the second-person form (‚Äú-st‚Äù) as second-language speakers of (Middle/Early Modern) English and thus transferred the /s/. The ending then underwent some series of changes to again differentiate it (i.e. dropping the /t/).\n\nIn any case, we know that by the time of Shakespeare (Early Modern English), both forms were in robust use.",
