I've seen a few people do small circles, and a very few a tiny vertical line like an apostrophe, but never a horizontal line. \n\nAll of it is easily readable. A fussy teacher might remind you not to put the bottoms of the letters below the guideline. (Like the \"sim\" of \"simplicity\". The tail of the \"p\" is meant to go below the line obviously.\")",

It will help you with writing faster, though, if that's your goal.\n\nYour writing in the first photo is perfectly legible. I wouldn't worry too much about the nuances of different letter shapes.

If I were ESL I might only use it with certain groups who already do.",
      ">should I never use \"ain't\"?\n\nYour sentence here is grammatically correct but it does sound a little awkward. I’d use something like “should I ever use ‘ain’t’?“ or “should I avoid using ‘ain’t’?“",
      "It's a matter of classism and discrimination. The people who dictate \"correct\" English want to feel superior over others",
      "As my middle school teachers used to preach, “‘Ain’t’ ain’t a word so I ain’t gonna say it.” It’s not accepted as a real or proper word, and would be seen as “hillbilly” or lower class/uneducated",
      "I would say both are just as valid as they are both Informal contractions used for similar purposes. Ain't is more versatile than aren't as it is a contraction of am not, is not, are not, has not, or have not while aren't is just are and not. It may seem like aren't isn't correct, but since it is informal it can be used more leniently.\n\nTL;DR They are both equally correct",
      "I use \"no it ain't\" more often than \"no it isn't\", and the only person that I remember using ain't with I is bugs bunny in \"ain't I a stinker?\" \n\nI would say \"aren't I\" in this context, but the use of ain't depends on where you're from, for the most part. Ain't is considered AAVE, which is just a different dialect. It's not incorrect, but its use is specific to the user.",
      "\"ain't\" does not exist in standard English, despite popular informal use.\n\n\"Aren't\" is the standard contraction of \"are not\".\n\nWe use many informal forms that are not standard. It is important to be aware of this distinction, as although these forms may be used in informal contexts, they would be incorrect in formal contexts.\n\nIn my dialect, we use \"dae\" for didn't, \"ay\" for are not and \"wor\" for was not or were not. If I were to use any of these in anything except for informal conversation (or to describe informal conversation), they would be considered \"wrong\".\n\nAren't I? Being the tag for the firat person is completely standard.\n\nFeel free to use \"ain't\" in informal contexts if you like, but be aware that many English speakers do not use this form and that it may reflect poorly on your grasp of English of you use it outside of an informal context.",

For example, the tail of  \"p\" in \"computer\" should go below the line. And \"e\" should all stay above the line.\n\n\nYour \"r\" looks similar to \"t\". The \"c\" in \"science\" looks too much like an \"e\". And the capital \"I\" sometimes looks like a boxy capital \"C\", especially in \"I like reading\".\n\n\nBut these aren't that big of a deal if you're just going for it being readable. ",
      "Your handwriting looks like you're used to writing in the opposite direction. Is definitely legible, but it almost seems like you have to concentrate to get that out. That's also just part of learning a language. To be fair though, my handwriting in Chinese is some hot bullshit",
      "Your handwriting is definitely more legible than some native speakers, myself included, though I agree that the lowercase r looks a little odd. \n\nIn general it kind of looks like you learned to write these letters by approximating the shapes (if that makes sense) rather than learning how they are formed. The starting point and the path your pen takes can make a big impact on helping the letters seem “right.”  \n\nHopefully this suggestion won’t be seen as too patronizing, but [this website](https://toddler-net.com/letter-tracing-worksheets.html) actually has very helpful worksheets for all of the letters with arrows showing how they are written.",
      "If you work a little more to make sure the bottoms of your letters stay on top of the line you're writing on, it will look a lot nicer. In the word \"college\", 'ege' is written through the line instead on top, which makes it look a little childish. Also, try to ensure that your lowercase letters are all generally the same height -- the 'p' in \"computer\" looks like a capital P because it's too tall.",
      "It's okay. Very readable, a bit messy, and you need to work on your lower case \"r\". Your lower case \"e\" also dips below the line, which it isn't supposed to do.\n\n\nSome letters do have tails that drop down (g, j, p, q, y), but e is just a little round guy like c and G.",

A lot of your characters are also done incorrectly.\n\nYou should do one of [these work sheets](https://external-content.duckduckgo.com/iu/?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.freebiefindingmom.com%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2F2023%2F08%2Fprintable-tracing-ABC-worksheets-PDF-downloads-791x1024.jpg&f=1&ipt=0cf5f2e7a0a1e83cd3d211995dac0597b2e8493492cf3f75a1f0c18b2dc80168)\n\nThe most important thing for clear handwriting is consistency. The [x-height](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X-height?wprov=sfla1) of each letter should be the same height and well spaced. The ascenders (bdhkl) and descenders (qypgj) will poke out of it, but should be the same height or depth. Your Es are descending and shouldn't be.\n\nIt's also important to be very distinct with things that can be misread. You have Cs that look like Es and As that look like Us.",
      "Your e consistently drops below the line, which is unusual.  Your a is also often below the surrounding letters.  Your r is strange and, as somebody else said, easily confused with a t.  The c in science looks like an e.\n\nBut none of that is unusually bad, and it's mostly aesthetic.  9/10 for function.",
      "Pretty good.\n\n\\* Lowercase \"e\" should not drop below the line. It's not a mirror image of \"g\".\n\n\\* Lowercase \"p\" does drop below the line. Yours looks like \"comPuter\" instead of \"computer\"\n\n\\* Your owercase \"r\"s don't look quite right.",
      "One of the reasons people are saying the writing is not neat is because your e should not extend below the line. You are writing e like a backwards g, and it makes your writing look jagged and childish, since there are so many e's in the language.\n\nFor example, look at your written word college, then compare it to what I just typed. The only letter that should extend below the line is g. Similarly, the only letters that should be taller than the others is L (written as a capital here so you can tell it apart from i easier).\n\nFix the e, and your handwriting will improve a ton."

      "I say this frequently. Not sure about it being the *most* common way (maybe something like \"(it) looks like it's going to rain\" would still be used more) but it's definitely something you'll hear frequently.",
      "In movies I think that's common. \n\nI'd say \"it looks like it's gonna rain\" \n\nPeople are usually aware of the weather outside so I've never said that to someone, though.",
      "I would say 'looks like it's going to rain' or 'looks like it's gonna rain.' I haven't heard people say it without the 'going to' or 'gonna' very often ('it looks like rain'). I might also say 'Looks like it's gonna be rainy today' or something like that. I don't think there's a most common, but this type of phrasing is plenty common and you'll hear it almost everywhere (at least in the US)",
      "that or \"(it) looks like it's going to rain\"",
      "Yes, in your scenario.",
      "Sure yes. Or ‘the weather’s about to turn’",

Also common are:\n\n(I) think it's going to rain\n\nIt's going to rain\n\n(Looks like) it's going to piss it down (this is not particularly rude in the context of imminent rain, but is definitely informal)\n\n'going to' is often pronounced 'gunna' (and is equivalent to the US 'gonna')",
      "A storms a comin'. I can feel it in m' bones.\n\n\nIt is a little cliche to say the phrase you gave, but it is totally fine to say.",

      "I think I'd say, \"(I) think it's gonna rain.\"",
      "I'd probably say \"looks like it'll rain\" or \"looks like its gonna (going to) rain\" rather than \"looks like rain\"",
      "Yep, that has become so idiomatic it's almost ritualistic. Many of us probably don't even try to form a new sentence for that idea--\"looks like rain\" just comes out of our mouths. The only reason we might not say that is if the weather was just part of some larger \"story\". \"Well, looks like it's gonna rain, so I'd better get these tools back into the shed.\" But if you were just expressing the simple idea that the weather patterns indicated impending rain, then you' say \"looks like rain\". If two buddies were just hanging out at a campsite or on the back deck, and the clouds indicated rain soon, and there was a lull in the conversation, you'd probably be surprised if someone didn't say \"looks like rain\".",
      "It's acceptable. Personally I tend to say \"smells like rain's coming\", because I consider the smell of rain to be a more reliable indicator than the appearance of the clouds.",
      "Yea, but pretty much only in the exact scenario you described.",
      "Also common, at least in the Midwest, is “think it’s gonna rain?” The proper response is grunt or say “well…” and not follow it up with anything"

      "He’s over-enunciating and talking slowly, so it is kind of hard to tell/ comes off as forced neutral. If you’re learning English, not a bad source to learn from.\n\n It’s hard to tell how he naturally speaks but there are a few things that seem midwestern to me. He has a really neutral r sound, (whereas northeast tends to be softer, northwest tends to be harsher, and southeast more drawn out) a somewhat overemphasized s sound, not a lot of glottal stops. He seems like he’s not moving his mouth very much and kind of skips over the middles of long words (pronouncing movement like mooment.) He has a fair amount of vocal fry which is sometimes stereotyped as a California thing but I think is just increasingly a normal way to speak across the country. ",
      "Hard to tell. Not southern not northeastern not upper midwest. I'd say west coast somewhere, but that's very tentative. I'm not sure if he's exaggerating his enunciation or if he has lisp-ish tendencies. Not the standard lisp that people think of, but I lump all sorts of non-standard mouth shapes into the term \"lisp\". An actual vocal expert could give better terms. His \"s\" and \"th\" sounds are what I would consider irregular. He says \"da\" (approximately) instead of \"the\" and \"dat\" instead of \"that\". His \"s\" sounds are clipped: \"becuss\" for \"because\" (which \"should\" sound more like \"becuz\"). Maybe he immigrated, so maybe he's near the border. Southern California, Arizona, New Mexico. IDK. Are you testing us and you know the answer, or were you just curious?",

      "Yeh American West Coast.",
      "If you Google stalk him he's based in Ohio, which is also where he went to uni. That's not necessarily where he's from, though. His accent is definitely neutral enough that it is pretty hard to place him exactly.",
      "Pretty neutral. Although he pronounces “th” closer to “d” at certain times.",
      "Sounds to me like West Coast, up North... perhaps Seattle-ish region. Just a guess. \n\nSomeone track this dude down and let us know lol!",
      "If I had to guess, I'd say inland California, but his accent is pretty neutral. Maybe he moved around a lot as a kid and made new friends by smoking weed with them.",
      "Fairly neutral and not immediately placeable. I occasionally hear a subtle d instead of th (especially in the video linked in subthread) which makes me think a lower midwestern or specifically Chicago accent is underneath there, but it’s not really obvious.",
      "It seems Southern. For me it's the way that he says 'pitch' kind of musically and his general speaking is a bit gravelly. I can't really place what state specifically, but I'll say the South or Southern Eastern Seaboard.",
      "Doesn't sound \"neutral\"; sounds American.",

      "I would say I have a good ear for accents in English, but I think most English speakers would understand every word you said there. As you mentioned, there is some improvement needed in the fluidity, but that comes with time and practice, when you no longer need to think of which word comes next— I’m the same way in French right now. One thing about your pronunciation, and this is a very common thing for Italian speakers, is words ending in consonants. Many Italians tend to add a “uh” sound at the end of words, which I wouldn’t know how difficult it is to stop, but that’s one thing I definitely noticed. Other than that, your grammar was good like 95% of the time, and your t’s and r’s and overall stress/articulation are clear and mimic the American accent well.",
      "You were very understandable for the most part. There was only one word I couldn’t understand. It was right before you asked for advices. Which to a native English speaker would be advice, never plural. Great job\n\nEdit to add: I’m a Native American English speaker. I don’t know how to add the designation under my name",

I think your accent sounds noticeably closer to the American pronunciation of words than the British versions but I’m curious what other people would think.

Anyone who speaks English in America would understand you tho",

      "Ola :)\nYour accent and speaking are quite good. I know several italians, you sound german lol\n\n\nThere are some minor changes to sounds you could make to sound more natural, but i think what would help you the most would be to learn/use the perfect tense. ",
      "Yes. Thank you. In listening again, the word was fluidity. Also, I heard a few words/ grammar errors, such as at 1:37: it should be “do incorrectly” instead of wrongly and right after fluidity near 1:48, it “still needs “ with an s at the end. Otherwise, in sorry I’m not a big help in telling you how to improve your accent except I agree with what has been said about adding a vowel sound at the end of words.",

    "text": "“Chinese” can’t take a possessive  ’. But “American” can take a possessive ‘s.  Right?",
    "comments": [
      "Two notes:\n\n*Chinese*, when used as a plural noun like *Americans*, must be preceded by *the*: *the Chinese*. This is because it is an adnoun, an adjective used as a noun, and that's how adnouns are used in English. (However, in your instance *Chinese people* would more likely be used.)\n\nThe possessive *-'*, with no *s* written, is only used after words ending in the letter *s*, not simply the /s/ or /z/ sound. So you can write *Thomas'* or *Thomas's* (either way is fine), but not *Chinese'*; it must be *Chinese's*.\n\nSo your sentence would need to be: \"Is the Chinese's English good?\"\n\nThat is grammatically correct, but not something you're likely to hear someone actually say. Much more likely would be: \"Do Chinese people (tend to) have good English?\"",
      "No, that sentence makes no sense and you can't just add an apostrophe to the end of a word without an S to make it possessive.\n\nYou also cannot refer to the entire population of Chinese people's ability to speak English that way, it's nonsense.",
      "You could ask, “Is the American’s English good,” as in, “Does that American person speak English well?” However, for a Chinese person, you would have to ask “Is that Chinese person’s English good,” not “Is that Chinese’s English good?” Calling a Chinese person a Chinese sounds both wrong and a bit like a slur to native ears.",
      "As an example, let’s replace the word “Chinese’ “ with “English’s ” in this sentence, since the word English also refers to people from England. \n\n\n“Is English’s English good?” just doesn’t make a lot of sense, and neither does “Is the English’s English good?”. It’s a very vague question.",
      "“Chinese” can take a possessive when it is used as a noun. Using non-European adjectives as nouns is typically considered impolite today, and so I would recommend treating Chinese as an adjective and including a noun. Example: “Is the Chinese student’s English good?” \n\nThere are a few exceptions where it is less impolite (or at least more common), including Mexican and German, but as a general rule include the noun. In older texts you may see someone referred to as “a Chinese.” Avoid this. \n\nThe one instance I can think of where Chinese could take a possessive is when the possessive noun is removed. For example: “The Americans’ style of cooking is much different than the Chinese’s [style of cooking].” This is a rare construction you do not need to worry about.",
      "Simple and short answer because I think it might be helpful: \n\nYes, it's wrong. The best way to express this is \"Are Chinese people (usually) good at English?\"",
      "Why is there an apostrophe after the word Chinese?",
      "[deleted]",
      "A caveat here is that you can say, “Do the Chinese speak English well,” or, “Does Chinese people speak English well,”with reference to the entire ethnic group. In that case, you don’t need a possessive.",
      "because they're trying to figure out if a particular English rule also applies to \"Chinese\" where a word has a sounding 's' at the end but doesn't end with an 's'. So the question is, is it Chinese' or Chinese's?\n\nFor example: \n\ngoose = \"the goose's feathers\" not \"the goose' feathers\"",

I don't see the discrepancy.",
      "\"Still\" in the lyric example that you gave means that something is continuing to happen. I'm not exactly sure where your problem of comprehension lies.",
      "\"still\", like many words, has numerous meanings and uses.\n\nIt can mean \"even so\" or \"nevertheless\" (\"Still, I decided to confront him\"), it can mean \"up to and including now\" (\"My grandfather is still alive\") , it can mean \"not moving\" (\"Sit still!\"), and it can mean \"silent and serene\" (\"the still of the night\"). All these meanings have some connection to motionlessness or a lack of change. \n\nIt can also mean \"even\" as in \"Better still\" (\"Even better\"). \n\nAnd it's a device for extracting volatile substances from a mixture through heating and condensing (\"whiskey still\").",
      "You’ve made many posts, but you’re still confused?",
      "It coontinues",
      "It means \"despite that\" or \"nevertheless.\" Though logically \"still\" should not be required when you begin with \"despite that/in spite of that\" (but as we also tend to overemphasize things), it still sounds natural (😄) following that there. \nI think it means something like \"anyway/nevertheless\" in such cases. \n\nDespite his warning, I'm still going ahead. (a daredevil that I am.😉) \n\nIs that combination what's confusing you?",
      "Other commenters have explained what's going on here with \"still\" in that lyric, but I'd like to add an extra thing I noticed about it. If the words were rearranged into \"But *you're still* in my way,\" it makes as much sense as the original \"But *still, you're* in my way.\"\n\nHowever, putting \"still\" first so that it's not part of the \"you're in my way\" phrase puts extra emphasis onto it, which results in the \"in spite of/despite\" extra meaning. Not only are \"you\" still in the singer's way (so, \"you\" were there already and have refused to move), but \"you're\" there even *despite* \"taking your time with the call\" and \"giving \"nothin' at all.\" In spite of being the one who messed up, \"you\" are now acting like everything can be fixed if the singer just gives in and lets \"you\" win.\n\nDespite everything, \"you're\" still here.",
      "I think that what's complicating this for us is the placement of the word \"still.\"  It seems clearer to me if we were to, just temporarily, move it to \"But, you're still in my way.\"  To me, it seems like an adverb meaning \"continuing through the moment in question.\"\nI think the reason it's given to mean \"despite\" is that it can be meant to imply it by virtue of a condition or fact remaining to be true, sometimes against the odds.",
      "“In spite of” and “despite” are synonyms. They mean almost exactly the same thing. \n\nYes, there’s nuanced situations where it’s more common to use on than the other, but that’s true of all synonyms. ",

It might indicate a specific regional dialect, how casual/formal you are speaking, education, social class, etc. There are plenty of examples where people flout the rules of grammar. A famous example is the use of \"they\" or \"them\" for a singular person. Grammatically, in the past, it always indicated plurality. People using grammar in the \"wrong\" way is one way how languages change over time.

So we can be close, but not close enough to crash.\n\nHowever, I believe we all want to get that zero distance thing with someone without crashing.\n\nThe good news is WE CAN GET IT.\n\nBut it's up to us, what do we want to believe,\nDo we want to believe that gravity (attraction) is a force as Newton said?\nor an effect as Einstein stated?\n\nIf we say force, there's a big possibility of crashing if it wasn't controlled.\nIf we say effect, there's a potential to merge together.\n\nHonestly, if human relationships were to be an equation, it doesn't have to be the gravity equation or any other equation. We can create a new one just for us, if we want.\n\nOR\nWe can just imagine that we are two galaxies.

      "Read, read, read. Find a book that feels like it's about your level, look up what school grade range/age range the book is recommended for, and try to find some books slightly above that. While reading, write down words or phrases you come across that you don't know and once you finish a chapter, go back and make flash cards for anki or something similar out of those words and phrases and study them. I'm studying Norwegian and this has been a helpful method for learning less common words and phrasing that goes against what I'm used to seeing. Sometimes words I know are used in ways I haven't seen before when I'm reading so it is helpful because you get more exposure to how words are used.",

But the other suggestion is very good. That said, if you can't put in the effort to find some suitable reading material, you probably aren't going to learn the vocabulary either. You need to find stuff you like, at a reasonable level, and that is accessible to you.",

Repeat the process until you have a book that may require you to think in order to figure out the meaning once or twice in those couple pages and for a minute or two each time, but overall isn't super frequent and doesn't take too long to figure out.\n\nIf you're wanting suggestions on specific books to start with and progress towards, I'd probably go something along the lines of: Dr. Seuss > Charlotte's Web > The Outsiders > The Hunger Games > Animal Farm.\n\nAnother great option would be if there are any science or history books and/or textbooks in the non-fiction section that are labeled to be for readers within specific age ranges.",

For example, \"best science fiction teen/young adult books\" and go from there. \n\n\nAlso, slight correction of what you said: \"I haven't read any books in English before.\" This sounds more grammatically correct and natural.",

Keep that in mind as you test out books. \n\nI'm more than happy to give recommendations based on what types of things you like to read, but it would definitely be helpful to have a better idea of the level you currently could read at, so I think following UnholyBaroness's steps to find your reading level is a great start! Feel free to message me if you need more guidance.",

Honestly, it sounds kinda awkward to me, because I don't usually think of \"getting down and out\", just \"being down and out\". From context, it sounds less like poverty and more like  emotional distress or disappointment. You've been letting the liars and cheats get to you, letting them make you upset, and instead you could feel better by listening to this music.\n\nMaybe there's a different meaning, or maybe I'm missing context.",

People will correct your pronunciation, or a word here and there, but when you are messing up the basics, people don't want to offend you by explaining your mistake.   \n  \nFor example, 'why do I stuck' is SUPER wrong. 'do' accompanies verbs, and stuck is not a verb. 'There was an urgent' is SUPER wrong - urgent is an adjective, and here you should be using the noun form 'urgency'. \n\nSome things need to be explained in your native language, depending on your level. The good news is that this basic grammar stuff is actually pretty easy to understand.",
      "Thank you for the corrections and feedback! It's a shame to see myself making so many basic grammar mistakes, but I hope to improve soon.\n\nHere is the revised version:\n\n**Why am I stuck at an intermediate level**\n\n\"It is because you feel comfortable, no urgency to go further.\" I learnt it from a YouTube video yesterday, and I could not agree more.\n\nThere was an urgent back four years ago, which helped me move from a beginner level to an intermediate level. It happened when I was looking for new job opportunities. Speaking English fluently would be beneficial to interviews, so I carried out a detailed plan and gave myself 2 months to prepare. I spent at least 30 minutes training my accent every day combined with massive listening training. I also attended a public speaking meetup every Saturday. The improvement was so obvious, and I finally got an offer.\n\nIn the past four years, with an intermediate level, I did not have big problems to deal with daily affairs. As a software developer, my level is also enough to communicate at the office. I know it would be even better if I could use English more freely, but there is no such urgency, I just leave it as it is. I get stuck here.\n\nSo why do I force myself to continue again? Yes, I use \"force\" here, I have to be honest: I do not enjoy this progress. I want to continue to climb the career ladder. I am looking for engineering manager or tech lead roles this time. High skill at comminution, not only speaking, but also writing, becomes so critical and it is also required.",

There are no words in Dothraki that contain \"thr\" as a part of a single syllable, and for that reason if there was hypothetically somebody who had Dothraki as a first language, they would struggle with English words like \"throw,\" \"three,\" and \"thrill.\"\n\nTo note: I don't speak Dothraki, this is just something I know about it."

You're pressing a button to activate it. \n\n\nIt's like you'd say \"start the car\" but \"turn the key\". You don't turn the car, but turning the key is the action that turns it on (just like pressing the button turns on the doorbell). "

I don't think you \"eradicate\" unemployment rates. Instead, you lower unemployment rates. Even using eradicate like \"I will eradicate unemployment\" feels incorrect as it's a bit more grave and serious than the sentence calls for.\n\nI generally don't understand the sentence, \"However, the weakness of workforce qualifications plays a big firewall here.\" I've only ever seen \"firewall\" be used in discussions about digital security. ​Hurdle, roadblock, or obstacle would be better, i.e. \"The lack of skilled workers is a massive roadblock.\" Alternatively, you could rephrase the entire sentence with 'barrier to entry' like so: \"The barrier to entry for most jobs is too high.\"\n\n– \"Wipe out\" feels like a strange word choice here. It implies total eradication, but doesn't suit this topic. Perhaps \"shoot down\" would sound better?\n\n– Is \"quitely\" your use of \"acquit\" for this sentence, or did you mean \"quietly?\"​\n\n– Rehabilitate tends to be applied to a single entity, i.e. rehabilitating a sick animal, or rehabilitating a criminal. You may have meant to use \"reform\" in this sentence.",

See also Flannery O'Connor's short story \"Everything that Rises Must Converge\" (O'Connor was from Georgia):\n\n>\"Can it get any hotter?\" she said and removed from her purse a folding fan, black with a Japanese scene on it, which she began to flutter before her.\n\n>\"**I reckon it might could**,\" the woman with the protruding teeth said, \"but I know for a fact my apartment couldn't get no hotter.\"\n\nI taught that story in a university classroom in Utah once, and read that passage aloud. When they heard it in my native accent, the class full of native English speakers seemed to understand the woman's line for the first time. So definitely regional usage—in fact, \"I reckon it might could\" might be the most southern sentence ever written.",
      "It sounds weird becuz you’re not supposed to stack modals like “might” and “could” together. Normally, it’s either “I might help you” or “I could help you.” This double modal construction is acceptable & quite common in some dialects of English in parts of the Southern US. People use it to be polite or a bit unsure, like “I might be able to help you” without sounding too direct.\n\nSo yeah, it’s not “correct” in formal English, but totally fine and natural in certain regions. It basically means “there’s a chance I can help you,” just with a softer vibe.",
      "Unless you're in a very specific region, that sounds just wrong. But, what it would mean is just \"I could help you\".  There might be an implication that I need a little encouragement to help you. Sort of \"well, I \\*could\\* help you, but I'd be more inclined to help you if you gave me a swig of that nice whiskey I see over there\". Of course, none of that would actually be said. Body language and context do all of that work, all the speaker needs to say is \"I \\*might\\* could help you\".",
      "I've never heard it, nor heard of it. I can't tell you exactly why it's wrong because, as already mentioned, you can't really stack modals. I can't tell you why you can't do that, though - maybe it's just a rule.\n\nI don't know what I'd interpret that sentence as meaning, either. Ways to rewrite it aside, I think I'd lean towards interpreting it as both might and could - it is within the realm of possibility that you will try, *and* you are able to - but won't necessarily do so.",

The latter is more universal so that's probably the right answer.",

      "The adverb 'ago' has been used in the sentence. It indicates a completed event. We use the past simple tense for a completed event and not the present simple continuous tense.",
      "They left two years ago is correct. There are three typical verb forms for a verb, be it regular or irregular. Regular example is cook, cooked, cooked. Irregular go, went, gone. \nThe first form is the present. The second form is the past/definite time.

Indefinite time words are not definite: ever, never, often, seldom, rarely, etc.\nSo correctly you could say \"I have never left.\" Or I have often left early.\" \nBut to say I have left yesterday is incorrect because yesterday is a definite time. Correctly one would say so left yesterday. (The three forms of the verb are leave, left, left.)\n\nAnother form not yet mentioned is the passive. This combines the verb to be and the third form. Example: do, did, done. The work is done mainly by the clerks. \nAn example with leave, left, left. A book is always left on that desk. Awkwardly phrased, but an example.",

    "text": "Text upon which activity is based:\n\n>!PAUL AUSTER has a first sentence made in heaven: 'I was 12 years old the first time I walked on water.' Too good to be true, perhaps, but it's not just showing off. It warns us, from the start, that the first thing we must do is take our disbelief, hang it on the highest hook we can find, and leave it there: Dear Reader, here be wonders. And, having started at the top, Auster induces in us the vertigo of the title, throughout this endearing and always silkily readable picaresque, by his ear-popping changes of altitude: from the miraculous to the preposterous, exalted metaphor to gut comedy, from walking in the air to crawling in the mud, Keystone Cops to Pilgrim's Progress.!<\n\n>!The unlikely Pilgrim, here, is Walt, a fly and grubby urchin on the mean streets of 1930s St Louis, who is talent-spotted by the black-clad Master Yehudi - is he mage or conman? - and trained to walk on air. To enable him to achieve his obvious potential, however, the Master subjects him to a series of grotesque humiliations and tortures. It's a process of spiritual cleansing like that of some extreme mystic sect, and one that's impossible to credit, however high we hung our cynicism at the start. Never mind: one day, from the dog-depths of his despair and loneliness, Walt just takes off. A few inches at first, above the kitchen floor, then gradually a couple of faltering steps, then on to the full over-the-water.!<\n\n>!And they're off. A pair of showmen now, Walt the Wonder Boy and the Master bundle around in an old jalopy, raking in the pennies from gawping farmhands at country fairs. You can almost hear the ragtime on the soundtrack.!<\n\n>!Nemesis, or gravity's revenge, comes in two guises. There is wicked Uncle Slim, the cruel guardian who handed Walt over to a stranger without a qualm, but who returns for a share of the loot; he is a pantomime villain with real malice in his heart and real bullets in his gun. And there is puberty, which exacts a price for Walt's innocent ability to 'let himself evaporate' so painful that his miraculous abilities, though they do not leave him, can never again be used.!<\n\n>!The narrative seems to go Awol in the second half of the novel, perhaps intentionally to reflect Walt's directionless adult life. But as a parable about learning to love, Mr Vertigo is strongly affecting. Its moments of deep feeling are sometimes jammed up against a piece of smart-ass dialogue or jaunty description; at others, though, they are expressed in a way that is as embarrassingly simple as the descriptions of Walt's aerobatics: love is just another miracle, that's all.!<\n\n\n\n\"Complete the following sentences using proper words from the text\"\n\nMy doubts come from two sentences in particular:\n\n1. He will be \\_\\_\\_\\_\\_ his way back to you in no time, you'll see\n2. The new administration focused on \\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_ corruption to restore public trust.\n\nMy friend thinks the answers are 1. Faltering, and 2. Raking, but I think 1. Crawling and 2.

Often, I focus the time we have together on the things that they could hardly improve without assistance, like grammar, pronunciation, etc. I eschew watching videos or reading stuff because I think of those activities as more passive, or things they could easily do on their own. However, I have noticed that many of my advanced students don't truly implement the knowledge they acquire, which makes their skills stagnant. How could I go about implementing comprehensible input in my classes with videos, texts, etc? How could I get the most out of it to justify spending time that could be spent studying grammar?

      "Not an expert by any means, so take this with a grain of salt, but you might be able to kill two birds with one stone by attempting to combine both aspects. Take some of your grammar lessons and throw in some reading or listening. Ask questions relating to what you're teaching, like, \"Was this sentence grammatically correct? How could you rephrase it?\" While I hate to say this as well, it might do some good to assign some weekly listening practice. It doesn't have to be overly much, maybe just an hour of watching some show in English. \n\nWhen I was learning Spanish I remember my teacher would also have us do interpersonal speaking activities, with her occasionally joining in. It helped us refine our pronunciation while also practicing structure; I suspect that this could similarly be applied to English teaching. \n\nAgain, not a professional, and take any ideas you like and tweak them to your needs. Good luck!!",

He usually asks us to answer questions about what they said (which can be really hard cause tiktok french uses non-standard grammar and pronunciation) and sometimes to transcribe the videos. If I were to try that on my own, there'd be alot that I got wrong, and even if I did actually understand something correclty I wouldn't be sure if I understood or not.",
      "Don't merely consume content. That should be done by students at home. If your advanced students are not applying the knowledge it is because they are not doing anything with it themselves outside of class, which they need to be doing.\n\nYou can do reading together. Having a student read aloud (so you can correct pronunciation) and then going over difficult vocabulary/grammar together, and then discussing the reading and related topics, is an excellent way to spend lesson time.",

The accent is just one way people identify them.",
      "Everyone is different, but it normally sounds pretty nice to me.",

Their pronunciation does not have to be perfect, their grammar does not have to be perfect and they do not need a native speaker's accent to be able to speak English and be understood. If we can understand what they are trying to say, even if they are making mistakes, that is OK. They will learn and improve. So if you are talking about yourself, then you don't have to worry about anything.

      "Think about it like:\n\n*I have (eat) fruit in the past* --> *I have eaten fruit in the past*\n\n*I have (have) surgery in the past* --> *I have had surgery in the past*\n\n*I have (read [pronounced \"reed\"]) that article in the past* --> *I have read [pronounced \"red\") that article in the past*\n\n*I have (must eat = have to eat) fruit in the past* --> *I have had to eat fruit in the past*\n\n*I have (must have = have to have) surgery in the past* --> *I have had to have surgery in the past*\n\n*I have (must read = have to read) that article in the past* --> *I have had to read that article in the past*",

      "Other than the verb “be” (which is highly irregular) and most modal verbs (which are defective, like “can,” “could,” “should,” “may,” etc.), all English verbs have:\n- a basic form ([to] see)\n- a present, third-person, singular form (sees)\n- an -ing form (seeing), which is sometimes a present participle and other times a gerund\n- a past form (saw)\n- a past participle (seen)\n\nFor most verbs, the past and past participle are the same (talked; held; cut), but, as with “see” (above), it’s possible for them to be different. \n\nThe perfect form of verbs is constructed from a **form of “have”** (have; has; having; had) and **the past participle of the main verb**. This is why it is possible to have two “haves” together; one is an auxiliary verb, and the other is the main verb. Note that the auxiliary itself can never be in the perfect (i.e. you cannot have three “haves” in a row in Standard English).\n\n> I have had a heart attack.\n\n> He has had a heart attack.\n\n> Having had a heart attack, he panicked. \n\n> He had had a heart attack.",
      "\"Had\" can be weird. In place of things like \"must <do something>\" or \"need to <do something>\" you can say \"had to <do something>\" (choosing the appropriate inflections if you need to).\n\nIt would be perfectly fine to say \"I read that article three times today. She heard me talk about it all day\" (although it would more likely be \"She listened ...\".  To emphasis that the aspect of being forced to do something, you can introduce \"had\". So, \"I had to read that article three times. She had to hear \\[listen to\\] me talk about it all day.\" If this was recounting a day that happened awhile ago, that's how you'd say it. \"Remember that time in school blah blah blah... I had to read that article thee times. She...\".\n\nBut, if you were talking about today, when the reading and listening is still going on or just recently finished, you would indicate that by using perfect present. So, imagine walking into a study room where these two people are, and they seem frazzled. You ask them \"why are you so frazzled?\" One of them answers, \"I've had to read this article three times, and she's had to listen to me talk about it.\"",
      "I think of \"have had\" as talking about past things you have done but are still in that state now. \"I have had to read this multiple times\" is something you would maybe say to a friend or study partner while working on homework. They say, \"This text is difficult,\" and you say, \"I know, right! I have had to read it multiple times.\" You are saying the reason you had to read it multiple times still applies in the present. Where if you said, \"I had to read it multiple times,\" you are stating a fact, and that is it. You are saying I did this. It could have been ten years ago or one second ago. \"Have had\" strongly implies you just had to read it again multiple times. It would be weird to say \"I have had to read it multiple times ten years ago\" because there is a strong sense of the same things continuing from the immediate past to the present, not something you only did in the deep past.\n\nAs a native English speaker, it is a weird tense when you think about it. It adds a more \"personal\" feeling to the phrase over the cold, hard, and blunt feeling just using past tense gives.",
      "> why we're using \"have had\" instead of like \"have have\" or \"1 have/has\" if its past tense why its not \"had have\"\n\n\"Have had\" and \"has had\" are present tense because *have/has* is present tense. *Had* is the past participle of *have*, so the whole thing is a present auxiliary + past participle. If the sentence were in past tense, it would be \"had had\": a past auxiliary + past participle. Tense will always be on the first verb/auxiliary.\n\n> I have had to read that article three times.  \n> I've had to read that article three times. (more natural)\n\n\n> I had had to read that article three times.  \n> I'd had to read that article three times. (more natural)",
      "**have + to infinitive** is a construction that means something like **must**, it's a semi modal expressing necessity. So if it helps, as you read the present perfect form, you can imagine the verb **need** in its place. So then the present perfect construction becomes **have needed to** and you can say that in your mind if reading the **have had to + inf** construction is confusing you because of two simultaneous forms of  **have** next to each other.",
      "It’s called the perfect tense. \n\nPresent perfect: Have eaten, have had, have run. (Form of have plus past participle.)\n\nPast perfect: had eaten, had run, had written, had jumped, had had.

      "“Why are we”* and “Why is it not”* not “Why we’re” “why its not”",
      "To answer your questions more directly:\n\n* There is no \"have have\" construction, so the answer to that is easy: it doesn't exist in English.\n* It's not just one \"have\" or \"has\" (I think that's what you're asking?) because that would would have a couple of different potential meanings separate from the above: \"I have to read that article three times\" means \"I must read that article three times\" (i.e., \"reading that article three times is a currently incomplete obligation\"), or \"I have a cookie\" (\"I possess a cookie\"). \n* It's not past tense, it's present perfect tense. As others noted, this means it refers to a completed action that is connected to something current or ongoing.\n* \"Had have\" wouldn't be correct in the same way \"have have\" wouldn't be--this is just not how we construct that tense. \n   * We do say \"I'd have to\", but that means \"I would have to\", not \"I had have to\". \n* As others noted, native speakers would just about always use a contraction in both of these cases: \"I've had to read that article\"/\"She's had to hear me\", which may be part of why it seems weird to you.

      "English compound verbs are differentiated in both tense and aspect (and mood, but that's another topic).\n\nIt can get really complicated, but in these examples the marker for tense is on the first verb, and the marker for aspect is on the second. Duolingo is using present perfect in this lesson. Present perfect denotes an action that started in the past but may or may not have concluded or to denote actions that started in the past and have been repeated a certain number of times up to the present.\n\nIn present perfect, the first verb contains tense and is conjugated appropriately according to person and number. The second verb contains the aspect and the perfective aspect is always the past participle, which does not change according to person and number.\n\nHere's a blog entry I googled.  It has an explanation for what aspect is and a table for tense and aspect but not an explanation for when to use them.\n\n[https://englishlanguagelearnersgo.wordpress.com/2012/02/20/verb-tense-and-aspect-chart/](https://englishlanguagelearnersgo.wordpress.com/2012/02/20/verb-tense-and-aspect-chart/)",

I don't really know how to explain the difference but I can take a shot at it. \n\nWhen using past tense, you're referring to actions that happened in the past (I know, obvious, but bear with me). \"I had to read\" refers to your post self having to read. But that's not what's being referenced here. Here, you're talking about your present self, who has already done that reading. So you use the past participle \"I have had to read\".\n\nHopefully that makes sense and hopefully someone can explain past participle better than I can.",

This is something that I'm thinking recently because the majority of things that I'm doin is related to English in some way I watch videos, I think in English and I speak English with some friends some times, so besides this what can I do?",
      "duude, your English is so good, congrats, i wish my English was good when i was your age. If you wanna improve your vocabulary, i really recommend that you watch videos about everything, like if you want to learn about kitchen vocabulary, then watch videos about kitchen stuff, its silly, i know, but it helps a lot. Another thing i recommend is learning some slang, that also improves your vocabulary and you will be able to switch between formal and informal speech when you need to"

    "title": "The Oxford Learner's Dictionary says \"unfortunate\" and \"regrettable\" are synonyms. Do you agree?",
    "text": "",
    "comments": [
      "They can be synonyms, yes.",
      "Yes, they are synonyms. But two words being synonyms doesn’t always make them interchangeable, it just means they have *similar* meanings. \n\nFor example, if somebody tried to schedule a meeting with me on Wednesday and I was busy, I might say “Unfortunately, I’m unavailable Wednesday.” But saying “Regretfully, I’m unavailable Wednesday,” would sound overly formal in American English. Plus it would imply that I actually do regret being unavailable, something “unfortunately” does not convey as strongly.",
      "Yeah, they both basically talk about something negative or sad happening. But honestly, there’s a slight difference in vibe.\n\n“Unfortunate” usually means something unlucky or bad happened, kinda like “oh no, that sucks.” Like, “It’s unfortunate that it rained on our picnic.”\n\n“Regrettable” feels a bit more serious or personal, like you wish it hadn’t happened and maybe you or someone else could’ve done something differently. For example, “His decision to quit was regrettable.”\n\nSo, they overlap but aren’t 100% interchangeable all the time. ",
      "They *can* be synonyms but each word also has meanings that are not synonymous.",
      "why wouldn't we agree?",
      "I do agree.",
      "Yes because regrettable is used somewhat idiomatically. Saying something is regrettable does not necessarily mean it causes someone to regret something (edit: as TenorTwenty mentioned however, it can connote that idea in certain cases). It just implies that perhaps the situation is wished to be different. “It was unfortunate that he couldn’t speak english” -> “It was regrettable that he couldn’t speak english.” In this example it means the same thing practically. It doesn’t necessarily mean that the man literally regrets never learning english; but to whoever else was involved in the situation, they apparently would prefer that he did know English. So unfortunate and regrettable can be used synonymously.",
      "In this one context, yes.",
      "there can be overlap but they are not 1:1.  \n\n\nif you say a person is unfortunate, it means they're unlucky.  if you call them regrettable, it's a different statement.  first off, it's kind of a quirky usage. and secondly if someone did use it, the meaning would be \"*other people*  kind of regret he exists/is the way that he is.\"  ",
      "In my mind, “regret” — and hence “regrettable” — imply an element of choice in events leading up to the current situation. With “unfortunate,” there wouldn’t be any opportunity to influence or control events that resulted in the current situation. \n\n“It was regrettable he didn’t apply for med school. He would have made an excellent doctor.”\n\nvs. \n\n“It is unfortunate he couldn’t speak English. I really needed directions in this city.”\n\nDoes that make sense?",
      "They can be sort of synonymous but there is a difference.\n\n\nImagine you lose your job because of budget cuts. From your perspective this situation is unfortunate, but from your manager's perspective the situation is regrettable. For you this was a surprise that you had no control over; for your manager this was a difficult decision but choices had to be made. Slightly different perspectives on the same event.",
      "Are “synonymous” and “equivalent” synonymous?",
      "Words have several to a dozen or more meanings, and the thing with synonyms is that they share a meaning, sometimes more. It doesn't mean the words are interchangeable in all contexts.",
      "I don’t agree. Regrettable implies the speaker had some kind of role in it or the ability to prevent it, while unfortunate implies it was luck (=fortune).\n\nAlmost antonyms actually.",

      "It means that I was told something or read something, but I want to find out if it was true or not. So instead of trusting what I heard or read, I'm going to confirm or disprove it.  \n\n\"My buddy Mike told me that wasp stings hurt. There's a big wasp nest in the barn..... time to go find out myself.\"",
      "This can be done with almost any verb + a reflexive pronoun, to emphasize that the subject is doing the verb. It's different from a true reflexive, when the subject is also the object. But on the surface it looks similar.\n\nA true reflexive verb is simple, and the pronoun \"myself\" or anything else is indicating that the same person is the subject and object of the verb.\n\n\"I burned myself while cooking.\"\n\n\"He drove himself to the airport.\"\n\nNote that prepositions in this case would come after the object, not before:\n\n\"You picked yourself up off the ground.\"\n\n\"She checked herself into the hotel.\"\n\nWhat OP is asking about is **a different use of reflexive pronouns that occurs in English to emphasize that someone is doing something first-hand.** The pronoun isn't acting as a grammatical subject to the verb, but is almost like an intensifier. The important thing is that **it is somehow important that the subject of the sentence is personally doing the action**, rather than some intermediary.\n\nYou also see people often say \"for yourself,\" etc. (\"If you don't believe what I'm telling you, then go see for yourself.\") The grammar is clearer in that usage, so this might be a shortened version of that.\n\n\"If you want something done right, you've got to do it yourself.\" (Common idiom)\n\n\"It was no robbery. They broke it themselves.\"\n\n\"Did he have help, or did he write this himself?\"\n\n\"I have been in a similar situation myself.\"",
      "Be careful with this one. \"It's time to find myself\" means it's time to do some introspection, self-discovery, make an important decision about my life, stuff like that.\n\n\"It's time to find out myself\" means \"It's time to discover \\[something\\] on my own\". \"Find out\" means \"figure out\" or \"seek the truth about \\[something\\]\" or \"research\" or any similar idea.\n\nIn \"find myself\", the \"myself\" is the object of the verb \"find\", just like it would be to \"find the keys I lost\" or \"find the leak\".\n\nIn \"find out myself\" the verb is \"find out\" (i.e. discover) and the \"myself\" is really \"by myself\", meaning I'll do it alone, so it's an adjective describing how I'll go about the finding.\n\nAlso, \"find myself\" is a very common phrase, and it's sort of a rote way to communicate that idea. \"Find out myself\" is not at all rote. So, you really need to rely on context, because maybe the \"out\" was just a mistake.",
      "Verify what you were told through your own experience.",

It's more like \"experience for myself.\" It's doing your own research on the subject, reading a book someone told you was good, going to a restaurant they told you was good, etc., to experience something yourself, rather than just believing what you've been told. It's not that you disbelieve the information you've been given, you just want to see it with your own two eyes, taste it yourself, etc.",

      "You’re going to love this. \n\n(You can look this up in Merriam-Webster)\n\n“To shell” means to remove (a nut, a shellfish, etc.) from its shell\n\n“To unshell” means the same thing. \n\n“Shelled” as an adjective can mean having a shell (crabs are shelled creatures) or having had its shell removed (“the crab is served shelled” means you’ll just get the meat)\n\n“Unshelled” as an adjective can mean not having a shell (slugs are basically unshelled snails) or it can mean that the shell could have been removed, but it hasn’t been (“the crab is served unshelled” means you’ll have to get the shell off to eat it.)",
      "To make matters a little more confusing, for shrimp you’ll most often hear to them referred to as “peeled” when the shell has been removed, rather than as “shelled.” For instance, the bag of shrimp in my freezer right now says “peeled and deveined.”\n\nI assume this is because the action of removing the shell from a shrimp is more like peeling it off (like peeling a banana peel) versus “shelling” which usually involves more force/destruction.",
      "We don't normally use that term for prawns. We usually describe those as peeled. Sometimes they're described as \"shell on\".\n\nYou are correct to think that the word can be used both ways, and it could be confusing, without context. Soft-shelled crabs, for example, have the shells left on - they're soft enough to be eaten. But a bag of shelled peanuts will have had the shells removed. You can also buy unshelled peanuts. But those will be obvious from the pictures on the packaging.",
      "What, you don't think that makes English fun? :)\n\nI'm not aware of any consistent general pattern for the un-\\[thing\\] rules, so you'll just need to learn each case separately or figure things out from context. Fortunately, the \"shell\" case isn't the worst one. You'll probably never encounter \"unshelled\" at all, and if you do, no one will berate you if you asked for clarification--many of us would be uncertain or at least be given pause. \"Shelled\" as an adjective describing a thing with a shell is also very rare. More common would be \"shell\" with a modifier: soft shell crab, soft shell turtle, hard shell suitcase. So, in the vast majority of \"shelled\" situations you can assume that \"shelled\" means \"the shell has been removed\" and that \"shell\" used as a verb means \"to remove the shell\". And \"shell\" doesn't come up as often as you'd expect. No one talks about shelling an egg (you peel an egg). You shuck oysters. You crack nuts.\n\nBut that \"simplicity\" doesn't extend to other un-\\* situations.",
      "Yeah English does this sometimes",
      "Context is essential to meaning, and whether \"shelled\" means \"something with a shell\" or \"something normally possessing a shell but whose shell has been removed\" depends on the situation. I would consider \"shelled\" to be an example of a [contronym](https://www.dailywritingtips.com/75-contronyms-words-with-contradictory-meanings/), a word with multiple contradictory meanings.\n\nSometimes the meaning is easy to determine. There are no common varieties of cherries which lack pits, so it is rarely ever necessary to refer to cherries as being \"pitted,\" and you can usually assume \"pitted cherries\" refers to cherries whose pits have been removed. In other cases, greater context is needed. \"Russia sanctioned Pakistan\" can either mean that Russia endorsed the actions or position of Pakistan or that Russia imposed restrictions on or otherwise penalized Pakistan.",

I asked whether they were shelled or unshelled and she said “shelled”. A day or two later I go to get some and to my surprise they lack a shell. She looks at me funny when I bring it up, and then my brain connects all the dots.\n\nIt’s so wild that shelled and unshelled can each basically mean the same things or opposites to both themselves and each other.",
      "\"Cleave\" can mean to separate or to attach unwaveringly.\n\n\"Apology\" can mean a statement of contrition, or a statement of defense.\n\n\"Scan\" can mean to take a cursory look at, or to inspect carefully.\n\n\"Weather\" can mean to endure, or to degrade.",

It's \"peeled prawns\" and \"peeled shrimp\". It's entirely possible that I'm just not familiar with the idioms around \"shell\" in the particular region where you saw that, so I guess I can't be much help.

      "In Australian English, \"off of\" is sometimes used colloquially but it's not considered good usage. \"Off\" is pretty much synonymous and preferred in formal contexts. We eat off plates, and we don't eat off the floor. According to [at least some American dictionaries ](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/off%20of)  \"off of\" is more common in US speech and means exactly the same as \"off\".",
      "I don't think anyone outside the US ever says \"off of\". It's just plain \"off\" in most Englishes. Though \"from\" would work better in all cases except \"off to\", where it's a destination rather than a source. Maybe Canada shares the US style?",
      "Off and \"off of\" are not interchangeable.\n\nOff of is more similar to \"from\". \"Don't eat the cookies off of the floor!\" (Do not eat the cookies from the floor, in terms of the cookies themselves are touching the floor as you're eating them or they have been on the floor and you're about to eat them) *Sometimes* you will hear things like \"Bought it off some guy\" and no one will consider it strange or out of place, even though it means \"I bought it from some guy\". \n\n\"Off to\" is shortened from \"setting off to\" (going to/heading to/on the way to...). \"Off to work!\" → Going to/heading to/on the way to work. You wouldn't be able to say \"Off of to...\". \"Off of to work\" would prickle people's ears and be noticeably incorrect.\n\n\"I'm off!\" – I'm headed out, also \"I'm no longer at work, I'm free\" as in \"Oh? Yeah, I'm off already, we can hang out.\"",
      "\"Off of\" is an Americanism. In the rest of the world, you should always just use \"off\"",
      "For “I made money off of DoorDash” you can use off *or* off of.\n\n However, off is slightly more informal. When speaking formally, it’s best to say “off of”\n\n——\n\nFor “My freind bought the chair off the street market”, it is not natural to use either. \n\nIt would be better to say “My freind bough the chair **from** the street market”\n\nHowever, street market sounds non-native. It’s better to use a more context specific word, or just market would work fine. Options for context specific words are: Weekend Market, Open Market, Flea Market (a market where people sell their old things), local market, outdoor market. \n\n——\n\n“Off to the next room” \n\nThis means they are going to the next room. However it’s a bit unnatural, I’ve only seen sentences like this in children’s media. \n\nIt would be better to say “On to the next room”, if they are showing the rooms like a tour guide or “I’m going to the next room” they are just going.\n\n——\n\n“I will cut the inch off the bottom”\n\nIt’s better to say “I will cut **an** inch off the bottom” **unless** there is a specific inch that the speaker and listener know about. \n\nOff here means that it’s being detached, removed, cut. ",

When you say “I’m off to the next room,” you really mean “I’m going to the next room” or “I’m ‘headed off’ to the next room,” so it’s acting as part of the verb phrase there, not a preposition.\n\nYou wouldn’t say “I’m off of the next room”. It would always be “I’m off to the next room” in that context.",

      "Phew 😮‍💨 thank you for your prompt response :)",
      "Yes, I actually love this question because I don’t know if I was ever formally taught this. Great question, OP!",
      "It is also possible, if less precise, to use “the,” especially when ownership is implied.\n\n> Sorry, I can’t give you this one, but I can give you the other one. (I probably can’t give you something that isn’t mine.)\n\n> My favorite glasses broke so I’m currently using the older ones. (They probably have to be mine, else they wouldn’t work.)\n\nThis pattern reflects the structure favored by many other European languages, which may not allow something parallel to “my […] one[s].”",
      "I think it's because it's only grammatical *because* of the adjective. We have general determiner + noun combos like \"this one\", and we have possessive determiner + noun combos like \"my X\". But, we can't say phrases like \"my one\" because we use possessive pronouns instead: \"mine\". It's only in the special case where we're distinguishing \"one\" with an adjective that we can use possessive determiners, like \"my favorite one\".\n\nI could see that being a little confusing. I'm sure some other languages use phrases similar to \"mine favorite\" to convey the same idea \"my favorite one\" does. (In fact, I think \"mine favorite\" is what English used to do, though different factors made it later ungrammatical (same process a/an went through).)",
      "That’s my favorite answer!",
      "I think ‘my one’ is grammatical, it’s just socially frowned upon in most cases - it has the sound of a sort of childish possessiveness to it; ‘mine’ just sounds more grown up. \n\nIf you use ‘my one’ most of the time you’re going to sound a little bit like a spoilt child who’s overly proud of their possessions. \n\n“There’s a few cars outside. My one is the red BMW.”\n\nI think there are cases where ‘my one’ makes a little more sense, if you’re emphasizing that the thing you’re referring to is distinguished by being the only one out of a set that is yours.\n\n“There are eight short films in the program this afternoon. My one will be the third shown.”\n\nBut ‘mine’ is almost universally going to be preferred. ",
      "Makes sense; thanks!"

    "comments": [
      "Yes, they are both grammatically correct and yes, there is a difference in meaning. \n\n\"I wish he helped me\" = \"I wish he was helpful\". It's a wish for a pattern of behavior.\n\n\"I wish he would help me\" = \"I wish he started helping me \\[with this task I'm currently working on\\]\". It's a wish for a specific behavior right now.\n\nExplanations:\n\n\"I wish\" is present tense, so the person is telling us about their current state of mind. \"He helped me\" is past tense, but it doesn't identify any specific incident, so it means \"he was helpful\". The wish is that his behavior toward the speaker had been more helpful, but even though it alludes to the past, the real wish is that it starts now and continues. The speaker's memories are filled with times when he was unhelpful, and the speaker imagines how much better they would feel if all those times had been filled with helpfulness. And the implication is that if that pattern of helpfulness had existed in the past, then it would likely continue into the future, which is what the speaker really wants. So, \"I wish he helped me\" means \"I wish he was helpful\".\n\n\"He would help me\" is a conjecture about the future, but remember the \"I wish\" means we're talking about the present. So, in the present, he is not helping. The wish is that the current state of not helping stops, and it would only stop if he started helping. So, \"I wish he would help me\" means \"I wish he started helping me\". But \"started helping me\" suggests that an activity is happening right now that the speaker needs help with.",
      "First is a repeated wish, I wish he helped me cook every night. \n\nSecond is future or repeated, but it's emphasizing that he doesn't help because he chooses not to. \n\nFor past it would be I wish he had helped me.",
      " Both sentences are correct, but they have slightly different meanings.\n\n\"I wish he helped me\" implies you want him to help you right now (or generally), but he isn’t doing it.\n\n\"I wish he would help me\" suggests you want him to decide to help you in the future like you’re hoping he’ll change his mind.\n\nFor example:\n\nIf your friend never helps with homework, you’d say, \"I wish he helped me.\"\n\nIf you’re waiting for him to agree to help, \"I wish he would help me\" fits better.",
      "Depends if you're talking about an imagined regular action or an imagined future\n\nRegular -> I wish he helped me\n\nFuture -> I wish he'd help me",
      "I wish he would help me.",
      "Both are grammatically correct.\n“I wish he helped me” literally has an association\n with being in the past, as “helped” is the past participle of “help”.\nBut people still use this to mean present tense sometimes, depending on the context.\nAn example might be someone complaining about their coworker and saying “ I wish he helped me”.\nIt’s understood that the situation will be continuing so “helped” is mostly fine in this context to be present tense.\n\n“I wish he would help me” would mean this person isn’t helping you, either purposely or not, right now or in the future.",
      "“I wish he would help me sometime” or simply “I wish he would help me “ also is used simply to state that they wish the person would help at any time.  Like help around the damn house.  I can hear my wife saying it now."

I’m sure that rules exist for a number of things but for native speakers something just “sounds right” or “sounds wrong”\n\nSecondly, there is also the fact that languages evolve. Words come in and out of use. If one person does something weird, it’s “wrong” if a bunch of people do something weird, then it becomes a dialect to that group, if most people use the “wrong” thing then it’s no longer wrong.",

It’s a joke based on her being a working-class woman and Sheffield using “upper-class” language.\n\n**Edit** - so many typos; sorry",
      "I haven't watched The Nanny but \"pulling a muscle\" is a common phrase to refer to a minor injury from overusing a part of the body. For example, pulling a muscle in your shoulder from lifting a heavy bag means that you gave yourself soreness from using your shoulder slightly beyond its capacity.\n\nI assume the joke here is:\n\nGuy: I pulled a coup.\n\n\nNanny, misunderstanding as a minor injury and trying to be sympathetic: That will heal itself.",

      "I'm really surprised that no one else has said this but it's more then just a standard \"you strained yourself.\"  The joke revolves partly around the fact that coup sounds similar to poo which is a slang term for poop.  The joke is that she thinks he is saying he pooped so hard, maybe due to constipation or other reasons, that he ended up hurting himself.  I looked up the scene quickly and you can tell that is what she is referring to be the fact that the line is \"Oh, well, that will heal itself but for the next couple of days sleep on your side and wear boxer shorts.\"",

Great vocab, seriously.\n\nRely, not relay\n\nOptimize, not optimise\n\n\"Help me draft\" not \"help me to draft\" Very very very technically we can say that \"Help me to...\" has evolved over time to being correct and I can think of plenty of times my country friends have said it like that, but for someone who is learning correct English I'd say to stick with the grammatically correct \"It can help me (verb)\"\n\n*There were cats, dogs, cows, and even mice.*\n\nMake sure you put the comma after that last spot even though nothing technically comes after it. Here's what it should look like:\n\n\"I use it heavily, from emails, presentations, to even short messages with friends.\"\n\n\"Keeping improving\" isn't correct, you should say something like \"Continuing to improve\" or you can throw in something like \"Keeping consistency\" \n\n\"I always had some excuses\" is fine but \"I always had some excuse\" is better subject verb agreement \n\n\n\"As an English learner, not a student but\" Make sure the comma is after that segment that is before but. It should be \"As a learner, not a student, but someone who believes...\"\n\n\"So it is the time to go back the right track\" I think you should say \"get back on track\"\n\n\"So it is time to get back on track\"\n\nYou could make the original sound prettier but no additional touchup will flow as nicely as the very common expression \"get back on track\"\n\n\n\"When you are advanced than them\" Should be \"When you are more advanced than them\"\n\n\nFun subject. The truth is, AI is very very good at explaining language. And you can absolutely trust it to teach you English, it's extremely efficient, the thing is you just need to know how to direct it and what you want to learn. Its like a big fridge, but there's nothing in it until you speak that certain food into it. It's very surprising how fast it's developing, and unfortunately it's on track to kill most translation agencies. It's a shame, but it's undoubtedly a great tool.\n\nBut yeah, your English level is pretty good, and you probably don't need a tool to help you actually form sentences. It's the little stuff you're tripping up on, and that's perfectly okay because the nuances are difficult.",
      "Thank you so much for helping me correct the mistakes. They are really helpful, from explanation, examples, to the technical background of the language. I will continue to write in this way, I believe keeping consistency is the key to be proficiency, and more advanced, no more excuse.\n\nFor AI, not only LLM usage like ChatGPT, but all these evolutional AI technologies, they definitely give our lives big shocks everyday. I am not sure if there will be a sad ending or a happy one, but I believe it is time to rethink how to use them in better ways.\n\n(The text above is also based on what I learned from your comment)\n\nHere is the revised version of my post:\n\nI do not use ChatGPT or any other tools to help me draft any writings, but I do rely on it to optimise my writings, to polish them, or at least it can help me to catch some uncommon used expressions. I use it heavily, from emails, presentations, to even short messages with friends.\n\nAs an English learner, not a student, but someone who believes continuing to improve is essential, I knew relying on AI would hurt the progress, but I always had some excuse. For example I told myself, I would study the revised version and learn form it, or AI would give me some insights I did not know. But I rarely did it as I promised, my brain just got lazier and lazier, and less confident on any of my expression, from writing to speaking.\n\nSo it is the time to go back on track, to express in the organic way and learn from the mistakes. I did not say we should not use AI, but only when you are more advanced than them, use them to work with you, not for you."

Usually, 'has gone' would be used for when an action taken in the past is still relevant in the present. Ubiquitous is an adjective, not an action, so 'has become' would fit more naturally. Thereby was used correctly, but I rarely see it outside of academic papers. In the sentence you used, it can be dropped without changing the meaning of the sentence. Like so:\nInformation Technology has become ubiquitous throughout the last 3 decades, revolutionizing the way we live.\n\nSanctions: In English, the word sanction is both a noun and a verb. When used as a noun, it generally means a penalty for disobeying laws or rules. Most often, we see it when discussing politics. Sanction as a verb can mean to either impose a penalty, e.g. 'Employers who break minimum wage laws should have financial sanctions placed on them', or to give approval of an action, e.g. 'The bishop sanctioned their divorce on the grounds of adultery.' \nIn your sentence given, a better word would be consequences, as your actions could have positive or negative effects.\nThe phrase 'As a result' would begin a new sentence, so you will want to either use a semicolon or period and separate the two parts, or change it to 'resulting in'. Your sentence can be changed into either of the following:\nYou should always anticipate the consequences of your actions; as a result you will live a better life.\nYou should always anticipate the consequences of your actions , resulting in a better life.\nBoth sentences above mean the same thing, juat a difference in phrasing.\n\nEspionage: Espionage is being used incorrectly here. Espionage is not a person, but an act someone or something does. For your sentence, the word spy or secret agent would make more sense. Also, the last bit is incorrect as well. 'A good idea' and 'however, a bad execution,' are phrases and incomplete sentences about the play. There are several ways to correct this.\nA) 'The play was about a spy who travels between countries . It was a good idea; however, it was badly executed.' In this one, we make the second part a complete sentence on its own and change 'bad execution' to 'badly executed' to describe how the play was performed.\nB) 'The play, which was about a spy who travels between countries, was a good idea with bad execution.' In this change, we connect the ideas of the play into one sentence. \nI do want to point out that in spoken English, you cna get away with incomplete sentences when describing something. So if you were speaking you could say 'good idea, bad execution.' After describing the play's plot. Do not do this in written english.\n\nHearsay:  I'm going to admit, I'm really confused at your sentence. Prominent means noticeable, important, or widely recognized; it's an adjective used to describe a noun. But, the word 'say' is verb, meaning to speak. There is the word 'saying', usually referring to phrases of speech most of us would recognize. So, are you meaning important people are speaking, or that there is an important rumor being spread? That would need to be cleared up. We would also use 'in' over 'during', as the phrase puts the accident in the past.  As to the second part, Hearsay would not have an S at the end. The first sentence seems to convey a single thought: 'they were killed in the accident'. Since it is one rumor or thought we're discussing, hearsay would remain singular. While I know hearsay as a plural form, I've never heard it used in its plural form. \n\nCalamity: This sentence is correct, as far as I can tell. I think hence needs another comma after it, but I could be wrong. You can substitute calamity with disaster, tragedy, or catastrophe if you want; it would depend on how severe the event was. Likewise, caution could substitute carefulness and have the same meaning.\n\nOverall, you did well.",

      "It's more like \"widely believed\" but I guessed \"prominent say\" would also work.",
      "Got it. So, just use 'it's widely believed'. Again, 'Prominent say' isn't a phrase in English, or at least, so rarely used most will not understand if you use it. Prominent tends to be used more when describing a feature of something, like 'their Prominent nose', 'the Prominent figures of society', or 'the Prominent feature of the landscape is the mountains.' When repeating information that's been spread, especially by word of mouth, we use rumor or gossip. If the information has been written, then we would say 'reports' or 'news'. So that sentence would be clearer if you put it like this:\n\nIt's believed they were killed in the accident. However, that's all hearsay.",
      "Sweaty Disaster is sending you in the right direction; you need a new word for \"say\". \"Say\" isn't the noun you would use here. Rumor, gossip, theory, idea, thoughts, even \"talk\" can be a noun. Chatter. Whispers.\n\nTo my surprise, the dictionary includes \"hearsays\" as a plural, but I've never heard this used.\n\nJust for fun, here are some other synonyms from the dictionary:\n\nSynonyms\nbuzz, dish, gossip, noise, report, rumor, scuttlebutt, talk, tattle, word",
      "Understood , thank you.",
      "Try this:\n\nThe predominant theory is that they were killed in the accident, however, no one knows the details so this is all just hearsay.\n\n\n\"Hearsay\" is literally what you heard someone say. It doesn't make it true. \"I heard Farmer Brown say they were killed in an accident!\" Did Farmer Brown witness an accident? Then we should talk to the farmer. If the farmer isn't the witness, then it's still hearsay, because the farmer heard someone else say it."

It's future conditional.\n\n\"When I get sick, will you take care of me?\" it's future conditional but as a question.\n\n\"When\" and \"if\" are sometimes interchangeable. So,  let's try:\n\n\"If I get sick, will you take care of me?\" That works, but we can enhance the hypothetical feel with \"would\":\n\n\"If I get sick, would you take care of me?\" The previous one was more of just a straight question, but this one has an element of pleading to it. I'm not just wondering if you will take care of me, I'm implicitly asking you to take care of me, or I'm admitting that I hope you do indeed take care of me. I don't know what tense or mood that is, but that's the gist of what's going on. You could emphasize the hypothetical further:\n\n\"If I were to get sick, would you take care of me?\"\n\nOkay, so let's apply this to the original tweet. If it were a question, we'd have something like:\n\n\"If I asked you to, would you help me break into my own room?\"\n\nBut this character is confident that their friend would indeed help them, so rather that ask, they are making a statement:\n\n\"If I asked you to, you would help me break into my own room.\" \n\nBut the specific condition doesn't matter, because they can rely on their friendship, and so we can express just the raw conclusion to the implicit hypothetical question:\n\n\"You'd help me break into my own room\".

      "It’s similar to if you’re learning a language with gendered nouns, and you have to memorize which article to use with each word, there’s not necessarily a consistent logic to it (thankfully English doesn’t have that). Unfortunately for prepositions, you just have to memorize which of them sound right in each phrase. Native speakers don’t have to formally learn it because we just hear each common prepositional phrase frequently.\n\nI would say probably the easiest way to think about it is to treat a simple prepositional phrase as its own vocabulary word. So rather than learning that “on” goes with the word “fire”, memorize the phrase “on fire” and translate that into your native language. For translational purposes think of that as its own vocabulary word, rather than two words.",

    "text": "I saw this in multiple examples. What is the difference between saying “of mice and men” and “mice and men” as in the novel? Could someone explain the difference, please?",
    "comments": [
      "The title comes from a quote- “The best laid plans of mice and men often go awry.” Meaning that no matter how big or small you are, you are not immune to unforeseen circumstances screwing with your plans.",
      "It’s essentially ‘to do with’ but as another Redditor mentioned Of mice and men is part of a larger quote.",
      "Two things. \n\n1. The full proverb is: The best laid plans of mice and men so easily go awry. \n\n2. Taken out of context, the title could be understood as a story or treatise on or about mice and men",
      "It's a partial quote - which expects you to already know at least the full sentence from which it originates.\n\n\"The best laid schemes o’ Mice an’ Men, Gang aft agley\" from an 18th century poem by Scottish poet, Robert Burns.  \nIt mean that no matter who you may be, whatever you plan can often go wrong \\[agley = awry or astray, roughly\\] \n\nSee [https://wordhistories.net/2016/08/19/of-mice-and-men/](https://wordhistories.net/2016/08/19/of-mice-and-men/) \\- which also covers how it relates to the Steinbeck novel.",
      "“About” or “belonging to.”",
      "It's true that the title 'Of Mice and Men' comes from a longer line in a poem by Burns, as others have written. But! The preposition 'of' can also be used to mean 'about', 'regarding', or 'on the subject of'. \n\nTolkien uses it in chapter titles. For example: \n\n>Of Stew and Rabbits\nOf the Return of the Noldor\nOf Beleriand and its Realms\nOf the Noldor in Beleriand\n\nEach of those chapters is about what is in the title.\n\nIt also appears in poetic language, like the first lines of the Odyssey:\n\n>Sing to me of the man, Muse, the man of twists and turns\n\nOr the first lines of the Aeneid:\n\n>I sing of arms and the man, he who, exiled by fate, // first came from the coast of Troy to Italy\n\nIt's not a common construction in modern English, but survives in the colloquial 'Speaking of ____'.\n\nSo in naming his novel 'Of Mice and Men', Steinbeck is playing with the language since the title can be read both ways.",

      "(speaking) Of Mice and Men.m",

      "Well, the novel is called *Of Mice And Men*. I'm not sure anyone would use just \"mice and men\" without the \"of\", unless it was just a sly reference to the novel, or perhaps the poem that inspired the title. It's based on a Robert Burns poem \"To a Mouse\". The line is actually \"The best laid schemes of mice and men gang aft agley\" (that last bit is Scottish, look up the poem for more info). In this, the idea of mice and men is meant to show a range from the very small and the very big. \n\nAlthough the title has a direct source, the use of \"of\" in this context would generally be omitting something like \"\\[On the subject\\] of...\" It's been a long time since I read the novel, and don't remember all of it, but I feel like the title might be leaning towards this usage, though it's meant to also evoke the poem as well.",
      "Thank you so much to everyone who spent their precious time to answer my question. I appreciate it. Have a nice day!",
      "\"Mice and Men\" is just two nouns. \"Of Mice and Men\" implies a similarity, a comparison between mice and men. It's a truncated version of a longer quote, but on its own it invites you to consider what mice and men have in common (that their best-laid plans go awry)",
      "While this might connect a quote, it also fits into a trope of titling.\n\n„Of“ as in „about“ — thisbis an elliptic construction „[A story/book] about/of mice and men“.\n\nTitling works this way has been a trope since antiquity, e.g. *De bello gallico*.",
      "\"Of\" can be a synonym (or near-synonym) for \"about.\" Think about, speak/talk about, dream about, a story about - these could all be replaced with of, although sometimes there is a slight change in nuance. \"Of\" can also sound a bit more old-fashioned, poetic, or literary.\n\n\"Of Mice and Men\" sounds to me like half a sentence. \"Let me tell you a tale of mice and men...\" I can't remember if that actual phrase is in the book, but it's a lot more evocative than if the title were simply \"Mice and Men.\" >!And there's only one mouse in it, anyway.!<",

    "text": "Trying to improve my prepositions and stumbled on these examples:\n\n[https://www.englishpage.com/prepositions/prep\\_w.htm](https://www.englishpage.com/prepositions/prep_w.htm)\n\nIn this page I've got a question about the use of  'to warn':\n\n1. They warned me about pickpockets in the train station.\n\nCould 'of' or 'for' fit here too?\n\n2. They warned me of pickpockets in the train station.\n\n3. They warned me for pickpockets in the train station\n\nI think 2 might be permitted. And 3 is probably me using the Dutch preposition and incorrect: (waarschuwen voor).\n\nIs that a correct assumption? ",

      "\"of\" works.\n\n\"for\" does not.",
      "In my part of the US, it's almost always \"warned about\". \"Warned of\" works, but it doesn't feel quite as commonplace. \"Warned for\" can work if you're talking about a length of time (Example: My mother warned me for years to stay away from girls like Holly.).",
      "\"They warned me of pickpockets\" sounds awkward to me. It's not completely wrong, but it would strike me as strange. \n\nI think \"to warn of\" sounds better with an object that's abstract. \"They warned me of the high rate of crime in the station\" sounds more appropriate. With a concrete object, I'd stick to \"about.\"",
      "For pickpockets in the train station:\n\n\"They warned me of pickpockets...\" works.\n\n\"They warned me about pickpockets...\" works.\n\n\"They warned me for pickpockets...\" does not work.\n\nBut like untempered\\_fate said, other prepositions would work if they're not introducing the content of the warning but instead describing the warning. \"They warned me over the entire semester that the final exam would be difficult\". (So, \"that\" can also work, but it's connecting clauses, it's not a preposition: \"They warned me that pickpockets worked the train station.\")",
      "\"For\" is never used for \"warn\" in that context.\n\n\"I warned them of pickpockets\" and \"I warned them about pickpockets\" are correct, \"I warned them for pickpockets\" sounds like some kind of devious ruse you are doing on behalf of the pickpockets.\n\n\"I warned them for their own safety\" (and similar constructions) aren't unheard of, though. \"I know they have a phobia of spiders, so I warned them the movie had a few in it for their sake\", would be a sentence I wouldn't think twice reading, for example.",
      "Just say they warned you FOR pickpockets, makes it seem as if they were warning you for the benefit of the pockets.",
      "Thanks! Noted. The \"for\" indeed was the tricky one for me, sounds good, but it would 'Denglish'.",
      "So, the best would be:\n\nThey warned me of crime in public places in the city.\n\nThey warned me about pickpockets in the train station.",
      "Yes, and, it is about a Dutch 'false friend' why I tended to use 'for', it resembles the Dutch 'voor'.\n\nEnglish: They warned me about pickpockets at the train station.\n\nDutch: Ze waarschuwden mij voor zakkenrollers op het station.",
      "You can warn someone of pickpockets, but not warn them for pickpockets; the latter implies that you are advising them on behalf of the pickpockets.",
      "Yes, that works. Or it would also work \"They warned me about crime.\" I get a slightly different feeling from the two versions \"They warned me about/of crime.\" With \"about,\" it sounds more practical, but with \"of\" it's almost literary, like a foreboding caution.",
      "Interesting. My partner is Dutch and I plan to learn it sometime soon, so this is good to know.",
      "Yes, I got it. If you want to know why I fell for 'for' I will give you the Dutch translation.\n\n'They warned me about pickpockets in the train station.'\n\n'Ze waarschuwden me voor zakkenrollers op het treinstation.'\n\nThe Dutch 'voor' in nine out of ten cases would translate to 'for' in English.",

      "Grammar isn't really were we have problems. Spelling is usually what gets us (to/two/too, or there/they're/their, or it's versus its), because we learned the language as sounds.\n\nIssues with grammar for native English speakers are typically things like:\n\n* The biggest uncertainty of course is whether to use \"...and I\" or \"...and me\". In school they beat into us it's almost always supposed to be \"and I\" like \"Bob and I (went to the store...)\" but there are legit cases where it's \"and me\" like \"Give the ball to Jim and me\".\n* *If XYZ were...* = correct. It's 50/50 on whether people say \"If XYZ was...\". This is the subjunctive mood and so should be 'were'\n* Should've... School doesn't teach us the should/would/could've contraction. People sometimes write this as \"should of\" as in \"I should of done that\". because \" of\" and \"-'ve\" are spoken identically. It's \"should've\" from \"should have\".\n* Verb plurality mismatch because the subject is singular but there's a description with plural in between the single subject and the verb. An example I can think of at the moment are things like: \"The garden with hundreds of flowers are open\" or \"The museum full of paintings cost $10 to get into.\" People hear the plural words and then speak the verb for plural, when really \"the garden\" and \"the museum\" are the subjects.\n* How to handle talking about an unknown single individual, can lead to clunky wording. When I was in school the 'correct' thing to do was to say \"his or her\" like \"Each passenger should pick up his or her luggage at the baggage carousel\". Traditionally teachers hated it when we use \"they\" in that place but it sounds fine.\n* Rules that have gone away\n   * Whom, people use \"who\" for both \"who\" and \"whom\" situations\n   * \"It is I\" is correct, but people will say \"It is me\" or \"It's him\". Neither of these sound correct or wrong.\n   * School traditionally stressed not ending sentences with prepositions, but the people who made traditional grammar loved Latin and phrasal verbs are a Germanic thing so there are lots of cases where you end up with sentences that end in \"prepositions\", which are really just the non-verb word of the phrasal verb\n\nOtherwise things like articles and verb tenses and irregular words don't really get us because we just have a sense of what sounds right, like you do in your native language. \n\nLittle children often get tripped up by irregular verbs but that goes away as they get older and hear the language more, like a kid saying \"The car goed away\".\n\nSome of the irregular verbs sometimes make people stop and think about them. Like what is it for \"drink\"? Obviously \"I drank\" but \"I have drunk?\" or \"I have drunken?\" or even \"I have dranken?\" all of these sound ok. There are non-irregular verbs that seem like they should fit the vowel change pattern but they don't, and stuff like that.",
      "What's your native language? Do you struggle with its grammar?",
      "Native speakers have an intuitive understanding of when and how to use articles. That said, it’s totally understandable that they may be confusing for you if your language uses them differently (like, e.g., Spanish) or lacks them altogether (like, e.g., Mandarin or Russian). \n\nThe same is true for phrasal verbs; they’re so common in everyday speech, we don’t normally think about them. Most native speakers could not tell you what a phrasal verb even is. \n\nHowever, there are other grammar “mistakes” that natives make, which are most noticeable in formal speaking and writing. For example:\n- using “of” rather than the contracted form of “have” (should of vs. should’ve)\n- using “there’s” rather than “there’re” with plural subjects (There’s two apples. vs. There’re two apples.)\n- (especially as children) irregular plurals (two mouses vs. two mice; two sheeps vs. two sheep)\n- using incorrect verb forms (have ran vs. have run; I drunk vs. I drank)\n\nThe extent to which these should be understood as mistakes or simply linguistic variation depends on the context. \n\nIf you can give some examples that confuse you, I’d be happy to help you with articles (a[n] vs. the).",
      "Natives of any language will grasp the language better than any learner could, that's just the way it is when you've grown up with it all your life.",
      "My dyslexia coach has to listen to me complain about grammar rules all the time. I struggle with some rules about singular and plural verbs in complex sentences. \n\nAs for a vs the, generic thing is a, specific thing is the. “There’s a dog!” Means some random dog. “There’s the dog!” Means a particular dog you’ve been talking about or is important to you. Like when we come into the house and our dog runs up we could say “there’s the dog.” \n\nAnother example, “Charlie is a dog.” It means my dog Charlie is a generic dog. Same with “Charlie is a Staffie cross.” Means that he’s a generic cross bread dog with some Staffie.\n\nHope my bad explanation helps :)",

      "No native speaker of any language has issues with the grammar of their own language (and dialect).",
      "‘the’ is used when talking about a specific thing that the person you’re talking to knows about. ‘a’ is used for something unfamiliar. I don’t know if I explained it well but for example:\n\n‘There was a banana on the table. I ate the banana’ = the reader or the person you’re talking to knows about this banana. it is a specific banana they already learned about in the first sentence.\n\n”There was a banana on the table. I ate a banana’ = the banana you ate and the banana on the table are two different bananas. \n\nIf it’s okay with you, what’s your native language?",

      "There can be several sources of native speaker \"mistakes\":\n\n* Sometimes when we speak we accidentally say something wrong for various reasons -- this isn't a case where we genuinely think what we said was correct, it's just a mistake\n* Dialect differences are often called \"mistakes\" by people who insist on a single correct form of English\n* If someone is trying to write or speak in a dialect that is not their native one, or trying to do a more \"educated\" or \"formal\" type of English that they aren't skilled at, they may make mistakes.\n* Finally, over the years self-appointed usage writers or grammarians have essentially invented \"rules\" that never reflected the way any native speakers naturally used the language -- of course if you invent a rule that doesn't match the way native speakers talk, you can easily find tons of \"mistakes\".",
      "grammar comes naturally to native speakers for the most part. spelling though?",
      "For the most part, no, unless it's some really obscure grammar rule. Of course everyone messes up sometimes, but that's mostly misspeaking, not misunderstanding the rules. That's what being a native speaker means; it comes naturally. We also learn grammar in school, so it's common to hear children make mistakes, but much less so for adults. I do make a lot of mistakes in other languages though!\n\n'The' is used when referring to one specific object, 'a' is used when referring to a single, unspecified object of a certain type. \n\nFor example:  \n\"I want a banana.\" - The speaker isn't talking about a specific banana, they just want one.  \n\"I want the banana.\" - The user wants one specific banana, and it's clear through context which banana that is, because said banana was already the topic of conversation, or because the speaker otherwise indicated it (such as through a gesture).\n\nUse 'the' when the specific instance of the object you're talking about is important, or if there's only one in existence (E.g. 'The United States of America'. 'A United States of America' doesn't make sense because there's only one United States of America). This goes for almost all proper nouns in most cases, as there's usually no confusion as to which you're talking about.\n\nFor certain things, there is one instance that is so much more well known that you can refer to it as 'the (object)' and it will be obvious which one is being talked about. For example, if you say 'the Moon' it's obvious you're talking about Earth's moon.\n\nThere are a few weird cases, as with anything. The is used when referring to a type of environment ( 'the ocean', 'the beach', 'the woods', 'the desert', 'the city,' etc.) Think of these as the concept of the type of area not instances of them. 'I love the beach' is equivalent to 'I love beaches', but people will nearly always use the former. 'The city' refers to cities in general, not a specific city. A few other things follow this pattern as well, such as types of weather (the rain), temperature (the cold), and light level (the dark).",
      "Be happy that you don't have to learn German. English is a simple language and the faults native speakers struggle with draw a mild smile on my face.",
      "With the exception of teachers or students of the language, the biggest problem native speakers have when discussing English grammar with a non-native speaker is the terminology. As we become familiar with the language even from the moment of our birth and become increasingly competent over many years with constant practice, we rarely encounter terms such \"subjunctive clauses\" and \"present perfect tense\", if at all. Our skills develop over time and the standard we achieve is largely dependent upon the quality of our reading material and those with whom we routinely converse."

I know online and group courses can definitely be cheaper if money’s a concern, but 1-on-1 almost always wins out, *especially* for intermediate and advanced students.\n\nWhatever you do though, ***keep studying on your own time as well***. No single teacher or course is going to make you fluent, and the more you study and **use** English outside of class (watching tv and movies, playing video games, reading books, listening to podcasts, posting on social media, chatting with native speakers, etc. in English), the better off you’ll be.",

Cuz here in school and uni we study them over and over again I'm still feeling that they are complicated and in real life u don't use them all? So which ones u usually use?",
    "comments": [
      "Native speakers use all tenses and their aspects. There are none that we don’t use at all. Some we don’t use every day. Many dialects have their own tenses and constructions, but that’s a different topic entirely. \n\nThe most common are simple present, simple past, simple future, present continuous, and present perfect. These are also where you encounter most of the irregular forms.\n\nAs for when native speakers use tenses in ways not mentioned in your textbook - these are the examples I can think of (I’m sure there are more):\n\nWe often use the present and present continuous tenses to talk about things planned in the future -> “She gets here at 9.” “We’re going to Denmark next year.” I think your textbook might go over this, but I’m not sure. \n\nSometimes we switch to the simple present tense (the so-called “dramatic present”) to tell a story that happened in the past (the context is pretty much always clear.) “So yesterday, I go to my friend’s house and knock on the door and she says…”\n\nWe also use the construction “was going to X” to talk about things that were planned or considered but didn’t happen. “I was going to reply, but I forgot.” It’s a “future in the past” that didn’t happen, and it’s very common.",
      "“Next spring I will have been on Reddit for 8 years. Or would have been, had I not been banned.”\n\nWe use all the forms, just not all the time.",
      "Native speakers use them all, though a lot of them don't realise it. Unless they have studied English, a lot of native speakers just think of past, present and future as being the only tenses. Natives learn languages organically, learners learn them technically. So learners know about the technical aspects of the language, while users don't know about them, even though they use them every day.",
      "Don't try to learn rules.\n\nLearn natural speech instead.\n\nTrying to learn rules isn't helpful - there are so many exceptions to all the rules that you'll just get confused.\n\nWe use lots of different tenses in everyday speech, so it's difficult to give examples. Is there anything more specific that has confused you about it?\n\nPlease remember to use a capital letter for \"I\" - it's important. Also, *please* don't abbreviate \"you\" to \"u\". It just makes you sound stupid.",
      "Could you include examples?",
      "Yes, it's true. There are various colloquial and dialectal variations.\nFor instance, some native speakers say \"If I would have seen\" where the grammar books prescribe \"If I had seen\".\n\nAlso, in everyday conversation, the future perfect progressive and past perfect progressive are both rare, although I'm unaware whether there are any speakers who avoid them entirely or if people just don't see the need for them particularly often.\n\nAnother thing: in British English we've seen a reduction in the usage of the present perfect (this began in the US, where the process is even further advanced) - so many people say \"I already ate\" where traditional British grammar prescribed \"I've already eaten\".",
      "All 12. Routinely, and often. It is not uncommon for a sentence to have very specific tense constructions.",
      "Verbs in English really only have two tenses - present and past. \n\nI run; I ran. \n\nAdditionally the verb has two participle forms - present and past: running; run.\n\nFrom that, a huge number of ‘tenses’ in English are actually formations from ‘to be’ plus a present participle, ‘to have’ plus a past participle, and then from forming present participles from ‘going’ plus the to-form of the infinitive. \n\nI am running; I was running; I am going to run; I am going to be running; I have run; I am going to have run; I had run; I am going to have been running; I had been running; I had been going to run; I had been going to be running…\n\nAnd then the future tense with ‘will’ is just a special modal, like ‘would’, ‘should’, ‘could’, ‘can’, ‘must’, which you can use not just with the verb itself but also with ‘to be’ and ‘to have’ to layer in even more options:\n\nI will run; I will be running; I will have run; I will be going to have run; I will be going to have been running; I could have been going to run; I must have been going to be running…\n\nThese aren’t, I don’t think, distinct ‘tenses’ to be learned; it’s a small but hugely productive set of tools that English speakers just instinctively stitch together to create nuances of positioning actions in time and certainty. \n\nAdd in the formation of passives from ‘to be’ plus past participles, and you get even more tense/voice variations. ",
      "The are twelve tenses (though some of them are really “moods” but whatever) for every verb, but there are not twelve distinct sets of verb *forms* that you might expect to go with them. Even *be* only has eight different forms, which (between them, and sometimes with auxiliaries) satisfy all possible persons and tenses. In some ways this makes English easier (fewer forms! Yay!) but it also makes it more complex (you need to remember that *were* is plural only when used as indicative past tense, but singular when used as thr subjunctive). A native speaker doesn’t have to think about that stuff. At least not as hard.",
      "I wasn't even cognizant of what some of them were called until I was learning another language.",
      "One thing is that in spoken speech we don’t tend the simple present tense, without any kind of elaboration/adverb. What I mean is we don’t say things like “I eat now” “ I go now.” We tend to say “I’m going now” or “I’m about to go”",
      "There’s 12?!",
      "Not only do we use all of them, but also most of us do so intuitively. But even those of us who have learned some foreign languages would struggle to name them all. \n\nGrammar has not been taught well or consistently a Ross the anglosphere.",
      "As a  new language learner, the 12 tenses are really confusing me",
      "Can you clarify what you mean by \"tense\"? Tense is how verbs reflect time, and there are only 3 tenses in English: past, present, future. \n\n\nPast: I kicked the ball.\nPresent: I kick the ball.\nFuture: I will kick the ball.\n\n\nThis is a big simplification, but hopefully it will help clarify what we mean and what you are asking for."

    "text": "I also wrote this text for my blog, but I decided to share it on Reddit  \n  \nIn this post, I try to describe my experience with the Duolingo app, how many times I use Duolingo, what I get from it, and share my opinion. I hope my post is understandable and that someone is reading this post. Thank you.\n\nI started using Duolingo on October 24, 2020, and I’ve used it every day. I missed or forgot to use Duolingo only 16 times in 4 years and 6 months. I’ve spent 1677 days in Duolingo, and during that time, I completed the \"English course\" for Russian speakers. Now I’ve started to learn the \"Intermediate English\" course for English speakers. But now I don’t want to complete each lesson, instead, I want to complete one unit each day. If you don’t know what a unit or section is, I’ll try to explain. My course is called \"Intermediate English.\" This course includes 4 sections, and each section includes several units. Each unit also includes lessons, maybe 30–40. Right now, I’m in Section 1, which has 51 units, and I try to complete one unit each day without finishing every lesson, and then move on to the next section.\n\nWhat can I say about the Duolingo app? I don’t know. Honestly, I think that little cute owl gave me more than I expected. My school knowledge was very, very small. I couldn’t even connect a few words to make a simple sentence. But now, after Duolingo, I feel more confident. I can make sentences, I can speak, yeah, I still make some mistakes, but I can express my thoughts and explain what I want, and understand my opponent. So I think that cute little owl is useful. But if you want to go further, you also need to practice listening, reading, speaking, and writing.\n\nWhat’s next? I’ll continue using Duolingo until I complete my \"Intermediate English\" course. After that, I’ll use Duolingo in a light mode to review and not lose my streak. I hope I can finish the course this year.",

      "Very good.\n\nThe only thing that stands out as for being non-native is \"my school knowledge knowledge was very small\".  It's not wrong as such, but it's just \"small\" is not used in that way by native speakers and it's very common for non-natives to use it for oblivious reasons.\n\n\"I only learned a small amount at school, I couldn't even....\" makes sense.\n\n\"My school knowledge was very little\" is a little better than small but barely, but you could say \"I learned very little at school, I couldn't even ...\" instead.\n\n\"My school knowledge is/was very very poor\" or \"very very limited\" is a natural alternative - meaning the knowledge is lacking rather than it has a small size.\n\nOr, \"We didn't learn very much at school, I couldn't even ...\"\n\nGood luck with your journey!",
      "Is it understandable? Yes, it's very understandable.\n\nWhat do I think, what's my opinion? It doesn't have the fluency of an adult native speaker. I'd expect the writer to be young or to not be a native English speaker. I doubt you want a line by line critique, so I'll just hit some highlights.\n\n\"Opponent\" is really jarring there, probably the biggest problem of the whole thing. Maybe just \"..., and understand other people.\"\n\n\"My school knowledge was very small\" is awkward. Try, \"my education is lacking\" (a bit formal though), or \"I didn't learn anything in my English class at school\" (probably an exaggeration, but we do that), or \"I took English in school, but I still couldn't make simple sentences.\"\n\nWhat you did very, very well was use “owl”. That’s a kind of metonymy, and it’s the kind of thing that makes you sound not just fluent but also creative and enjoyable to listen to. In English it would be “that cute little owl”, not “that little cute owl”. Adjective order is very strict in English. So\n\n“Honestly, that cute little owl gave me more than I expected.” Love it!!!",
      "That's pretty much completely understandable. The main points I would make:\n\nFirst,  I'm a big fan of keeping items in a list parallel grammatically. In your first sentence, you list four things you are trying to do:\n\n*  describe my experience with the Duolingo app\n* how many times I use Duolingo\n* what I get from it \n* share my opinion\n\nThe first and last items start with verbs (describe, share) that follow \"try to,\" while the second and third are noun clauses. It would be better to make them all the same, like\n\n*  describe my experience with the Duolingo app\n* summarize ow many times I use Duolingo\n* explain what I get from it \n* share my opinion\n\nThen, I agree with the other poster that \"opponent\" is the wrong word unless you're talking about something like a formal debate.\n\nThird, you write\n\n>  each section includes several units...Right now, I’m in Section 1, which has 51 units, \n\n51 is say too high a number for \"several.\" I would give a range like you do for lessons or just say something like \"multiple\" or \"some number of\" or something vague like that. \"Several\" really does imply less than 10 at most.",

      "Yes, that's perfectly acceptable.\n\nAn unasked-for criticism of your sentence: The sentence is clunky because of the repitition of the words \"difference\" and \"sizes\". You can change this by losing \"of different sizes\", which I don't think is neccessary. Perhaps in context it is important that you are talking about a big thing and a small thing looking the same size, but you can also make two medium things look big and small.",
      "The last word should be \"size\", not sizes, because you're talking about the property.\n\nThey don't really *create* an illusion. They *give the* illusion. And it's not *about* their actual size, just *of* it.\n\nAn illusion of their relative size is rather awkward, because we haven't said what their size actually is. It would make sense if we knew they were actually the same size, for example.\n\nI think \"false impression\" works better, anyway.\n\nAnd... I'm going to use \"Placing\" as a verb, because then it makes more sense - the action of placing them is what gives the impression (or creates the illusion).\n\nAnd as always, keep things simple. Often, it's clearer if you use fewer words.\n\n> Placing objects at a different distances from an observer can give a false impression of their size.\n\n(Or \"relative size\", if you like.)",
      "Both sentences work, but the second one sounds more natural to me. \"Create an illusion\" is a common phrase, so it flows better than \"give a false impression.\"\n\nI had a similar confusion a while back with \"illusion\" vs. \"delusion\"turns out \"illusion\" is more about perception (like optical illusions), while \"delusion\" is a false belief. Little distinctions like this trip me up sometimes!",
      "Shouldn't it be \"actual size\" instead of \"relative size?\" Relative size is how large or small an object appears when compared to something else, whereas actual size refers to its real dimensions. For example, the sun and moon have nearly identical relative sizes, which is why the moon completely obscures the sun during a solar eclipse. But their actual sizes are extremely different.  \n\nIf you place a soccer ball 10 feet from you and another one 100 yards away, their relative size would be extremely different. Or if you took a real pool ball and set it 10 feet away, then paint a beach ball to look like that pool ball and put that some distance away, you could make it seem like they're side by side.  \n\nThat's not giving you a false impression of their relative size, but of their actual size.",

      "> **It seems to me that** you loved this **author’s narrative style** in the ~~previous~~ pages **leading up to** this decisive juncture in the plot. \n\nMy strongest objection is to “It feels that.” Using “feel” in an impersonal expression like this is a bit odd. You could potentially use “It feels like,” but even that is a bit colloquial given the tone of the rest of the sentence.\n\nThe rest of my corrections are mainly stylistic.",
      "Is it the *narration* that you think your friend enjoyed, or the *story*? Everything else outside the use of the word “narration” makes me think that she likes the characters and the story and she hopes she’s right about what direction it’s going in.\n\nNarration is a more specific aspect of a story where the storyteller themselves is describing what is happening. We usually talk about narration when we talk about the style or angle of the delivery of the story rather than its contents. Some novels are narrated by one of the characters in the novel itself which either gives us insight into their own motivations or potentially skews the story — unreliable narrators have been a storytelling device for a long time.\n\nIf I’m not wrong in saying all this, then the word you were going for might have been *narrative*, but I think *story* is much more natural in casual speech. I would’ve said “I’m glad you really love this story even before knowing what direction it will go in”",
      "It's a little confusing, because the way you have written it makes me expect some sort of change. Basically, \"you liked it before the juncture\", so I'm prepared to hear something about her not liking it after the juncture. But your explanation makes it clear that she very much likes the book so far without any qualifiers. So I think you've decorated your comment too much.\n\nI'll echo another commenter about the \"It feels that\" part. I think you either own the feeling, e.g. \"I feel like...\", or you use \"It seems like...\" or even \"it sounds like...\". In this usage, you'd almost always hear \"like\" rather than \"that\" even though \"that\" probably feels more grammatical. \"That\" tends to add formality or sound like one is trying to be very precise, but in such a casual conversation, that probably wouldn't be desired.\n\nFinally, this is more verbose that a native speaker would be for such a conversation. So, if I've captured the intent, I would have said something like\n\n\"It seems like you really enjoy this author's style.\"\n\n\"It seems like you've enjoyed this book so far.\"\n\n\"It seems like you're really enjoying this book.\"\n\n\"It sounds like you really like his/her/their \\[pick the appropriate pronoun\\] narrative style based on what you've read so far.\" And really, the last bit would probably go unstated: \"It sounds like you really like their style so far.\"\n\nIf you really want me to stick close to your original, I'd probably say (dropping the \"this author\" because that's strongly implied):\n\n\"It sounds like you've really enjoyed the narration up to this point in the story.\"",
      "Thanks for making me aware of my mistakes! I now understand that using *feel* in this situation is wrong because I'm talking to a person who isn't very close. Is the part *in the previous pages before reaching* absolutely wrong? I know your suggestion sounds more natural but could you give your opinion about my original sentence?",
      "Our conversation regarding the book was very short and I implied from her excitement that she liked the narration as well as the theme it's based on. She didn't disclose much about it only to not spoil it for me but she did tell me it is about people of colour and its name, Sula by Tim Morrison.",
      "I had written *the decisive juncture* because it's the point in the novel where my friend would've decided if she'll buy other novels by this author or not. Basically, she was enjoying the flow of how the story is progressing so far and expects it to end well.",
      "It’s not absolutely incorrect, but it is quite awkward. At the very least, I would delete “in the previous pages;” it’s implied by “before.”",
      "Ah, gotcha. Although you *inferred* that from her excitement. She implied it.",
      "Right, but was it a special juncture in the plot, or just accidentally where her bookmark was at that moment? Like, was she saying\n\n\"This book has been really good til now, but it's reached a point where the two main characters need to learn to cooperate or destroy each other's lives, and in the past my experience is that when the author lets them destroy each other, I lose interest. So I'm really hoping that this time they learn to cooperate.\"\n\nIf it's that kind of juncture, then it makes sense to call it out. She is explicitly making this plot juncture her decision point. But if it's just, \"I've really liked it so far and I hope that continues\", then it has nothing to do with a plot juncture.\n\nI guess what I'm saying is that \"juncture\" is a very conspicuous word choice.",
      "[deleted]",
      "Yes! Since she's *clear* about her feelings for this book and I understood it based on that. It needs to be *infer* due to this reason, right?",
      "I've an inkling that she didn't want to spoil it for me as I had asked her for recommendations. She only told me about what inspired her to pick this book without revealing much about the plot. She did, however, enthusiastically say that she's loving the book so far and if its story unfurls the way she's predicted she'll order more novels of the same author from Amazon.",
      "They’re about the same. You can swap them out interchangeably.",
      "Well that’s one thing, for sure — if she’s saying it directly then she’s not implying it. If she does not say it directly, but you can still tell that it’s true based on what she does say, she is implying it. \n\nThe point I was making is that if *you* imply something, which is the way you worded it, then you indirectly get across (presumably to your friend) something you mean without saying it directly. So the problem is that in this situation, you’re getting who’s doing the implying backward; she’s the one implying her experience of the book, not you. \n\nOn the other hand, if you are *interpreting* the things she says to mean things she is not saying directly — in other words, you believe you recognise something she is implying — then you would be *inferring* that from her words. That’s what inferring means. So in that situation, she’s implying it and you’re inferring it.",
      "Okay, well, you know the context better than I, so you are the ultimate arbiter of what's \"right\". All I will say as a native English speaker is that \"juncture\" is conspicuous in that sentence, so it should probably be very relevant, otherwise \"point\" might do the job just as well."

      "Well, “ma” is just a very basic combination of sounds. “Mm” is vocalising with your mouth closed, and “ah” is vocalising with your mouth open (without moving your tongue). I don’t think it’s a coincidence that all babies make this sound. The coincidence is that so many cultures chose it as the basis of their word for “mother”. \n\nI can see the logic behind it: baby makes a sound, seems to be directing it toward their primary caregiver, the sound takes on that meaning. But I do think it’s curious how the words for “father” are more variable (dada, papa, etc).",
      "labial and dental consonants are the easiest to pronounce for infants, that's why it's common in a lot of languages. in my language (Tagalog), father is *tatay/ama* and mother is *nanay/ina.*",
      "Family names are almost always derived from whatever the easiest sounds a baby can make are. Ma is just opening your mouth while vocalizing. \n\nMoms are historically the primary caregivers so they get that one. \n\nDads usually get either Da or Ba which is still easy but takes more effort and is the second sound a baby can make. \n\nIt’s not magic or anything. It’s just people collectively like being a baby’s first few words.",
      "Not only is it easy to say, but babies tend to make the sound when they are crying because of being hungry. Baby cries often vary a little depending on the cause, and there's a tendency for hunger cries to sound a bit more nasaly, like \"ma/na/nya\". Makes sense to me that it becomes associated with the mother.",
      "My baby is 3 weeks old and has been saying 'ma' since day one. It's part of her hunger/frustration cry. They all do it, way before language is in the mix.",

      "They have a pretty subtle difference between them. “I’m liking” is better for a currently happening event, to express pleasant surprise by how much you like something. “I like” is less about “Wow this is cool right now” and just express your preferences.\n\nIf you’re at the club and the music is really good, you might say “I’m liking this club,” and technically both make sense, the “I’m liking” version is better to express that right now, this club is exactly the right place.",
      "To my ears, “I’m liking this” drives home the point that you’re referring to a situation currently unfolding. Like a good song, a meal, or an experience that isn’t over yet. \n\nAbout a book, you could say “I’m liking this” while you’re in the process of reading it, but you would say “I like this” if you’re pulling it off a shelf to show to someone after you’ve already read it.",
      "Yeah, when McDonald's came out with that slogan probably 20 years ago now it sounded weird, which is probably part of why they chose it, because it's distinct so they can run marketing on it.\n\n\"I'm liking this\" is what you'd say as you're chewing something with your mouth full--exactly in the middle of eating something new.\n\n\"I like this\" is what you'd say once you finish the piece of whatever and you're telling your friend what you thought.\n\nAlso, \"I'm liking this\" to me has an additional aspect of you like it more than you were expecting, or you weren't expecting it to be very good, because you're only mid-way through it and it's already enough to declare that you like it.",
      "There's a large amount of overlap between them, and you could honestly use either in most situations with little trouble. \n\nIn my own experience though, \"I'm liking this\" implies that the activity/thing/etc is currently ongoing. It can also be seen as a preliminary statement that could change later. For example, if you were trying on new shoes you might say \"I'm liking this\" to say that \"everything seems good so far\". \" You might walk around a bit and realize that the shoes are not a good fit after all. \n\n\"I like this\" tends to imply a bit more of a permanent state. I could say \"I like pizza\" regardless of if we are eating pizza right now (or even if we're not eating at all).",

They are a class of verb which don’t describe actions, but states - mental states:  “want, know, need, understand.”  Feelings:  “like, love, hate, prefer.”  Relationships:  “owe, belong, trust.”  Physical relationships:  “contain, involve, comprise.”  Existence:  “be, seem, appear, exist.”  \n\nThese verbs aren’t usually used in continuous forms.  \n\nWhere they are used in continuous form, they usually indicate a temporary and unusual situation.  “He is normally very nice (state).  Today he is being very nasty (unusual temporary behaviour).  \n\nSo, “I like this” would indicate a normal, general preference for something.  “I’m liking this” would indicate a temporary, unusual or contingent situation.",

In the case of “friend”, /n/ has nearly the same tongue position as /d/, so there may not be an audible difference between “fren” and “friend”, but native speakers can usually hear the difference between for example “arrive” with no D at all and “arrived” with an inaudibly released D, because we hear the beginning of the D sound. \n\nIn the case of your example, my final D becomes audible when followed by a vowel. It’s “frienda mine” not “frenna mine”.",
      "\"frien_dof mine\"",
      "The d is usually pronounced, it may be less obvious when someone speaks quickly. It's much less common to drop it. I'm not quite sure what you mean by \"friend_dof\" and \"frien_nof\"",
      "[deleted]",
      "in the American English I speak, I say the d, though it does tend to be attached to the of: fren-duhv is how it sounds to me (apologies for not using the ipa) when I say the phrase.\n\n  \nI do know people for whom the d is silent, in very casual speech",
      "You can say both.",
      "Depends completely on accent, register, and tone. \n\nI'm from Canada, and depending on who I'm speaking to, what the context is, and how fast I'm speaking, I could say \"Joey's_sa frien_nomine\" (note the F gets dropped), \"Joey's_sa frien_nof mine\", \"Joey's_sa friend_da mine\" (\"of\" becomes something like \"da\"), or \"Joey's_sa friend_dof mine\". \n\nIncluding the D sounds is a little more formal, and might feel better coming out of your mouth in this context.\n\n*Tangentially related note from my example in the contraction in \"Joey's\": This is less formal and more familiar if speaking to a friend or equal, but depending on your first language and linguistic background, might be harder to say than \"Joey is\" (I know Spanish and Farsi, and other speakers sometimes have trouble with leading S sounds). If this is the case, you would be just trading some familiarity with ease of saying the words themselves, which is perfectly reasonable and something that comes with practice.*",
      "Definitely both regional and circumstantial. I’d say “fren-duv-mine” typically.",
      "While the \"d\" might be dropped by some speakers, what's far more likely to be dropped is the \"f\".\n\nfriend\\`a\\`mine\n\nAnd if one were to drop the \"d\", it wouldn't be \"frien\\`of\\`mine\" but \n\nfrien\\`a\\`mine\n\nI personally can't imagine myself ever dropping the \"d\" entirely, but it could get kinda reduced (see what I did there with \"kinda\").\n\nRegarding your question whether it's true that final \"d\" and \"t\" are normally silent, I would say that is not anywhere close to being universally true. Those sounds do experience a lot of mutation, \"t\" often slides into \"d\", \"d\" often slides into a something almost like an \"n\", but I think it's very rare that they are actually silent. \n\nHere's an example (based on my own dialect at least). Pronounce the phrase \"own go\" (I know that doesn't make a sentence, but just pretend it could be part of a sentence and pronounce it as such). Now consider the phrase \"don't go\" (again, imagine how it would sound if it were in an actual sentence). The \"don\" in \"don't go\" sounds exactly like the \"own\" in \"own go\", but \"don't go\" sounds different than \"own go\". There's a little stop in \"don't go\". So even though you don't hear a \"t\", the \"t\" is definitely not silent. Or if you want to call it silent, you still must acknowledge that it has an effect on the surrounding sounds. So taking this silent rule too seriously would actually damage your pronunciation.\n\nWhen those letters do become silent, it's because of a clash with a following letter. \"Stand tall\" sounds pretty much like \"stan tall\", but that's obviously because of the awkwardness of \"d\"+\"t\" right next to each other.",

      "I would say that the -ing form makes it sound like the need is bit more general or indeterminate in time. for example, saying “the kitchen needs cleaning” has a bit more of a sense that this is a task somewhere on the to-do list, and maybe it’s too big a job to do all at once so the cleaning may occur over time. It has a bit of a sense that the kitchen would benefit from the process of cleaning, so even if you don’t finish the whole job, making progress would be good over time. whereas to say “the kitchen needs to be cleaned” makes it sound more like this has to be done at a definite time, or that completing the job has particular importance.",
      "The verb \"need\" typically takes a noun as object. \"I need sleep\". Some verbs can be turned into nouns with \"-ing\". Such nouns are called gerunds. The verb \"correct\" can be turned Into the gerund \"correcting\", and thus we have \"your mistake needs CORRECTing\". \"Your toenails need CLIPping\". \"Your dough needs KNEADing\". \"Your muscles need MASSAGing\". In all these cases, the need is some deliberate action, and so the dynamic character of gerunds works well in this construction. \"Your mistake needs correction\" just doesn't quite sound right, because it's too static. We're all just sitting here seeing the deficiency. But \"your mistake needs correcting\" is more of a prompt--\"hey, don't just sit there, go fix your mistake\". Basically, think of the action you want, turn it into a noun/gerund and declare that it is needed. Hmm, that wall would look better with a fresh coat of paint.

You’re going to be angry _if you find out_ that they didn’t do the homework.\n\nAnd partly because we don’t often talk about the onset of the process of getting angry. We talk about the state of being angry and the state of becoming angry, but it seems odd to predict that there will be a moment in the future when you are going to start getting angry. It’s cleaner to predict either that you will be in a state of growing anger, or that you will be at a specific level of anger. \n\nWhich is the other thing: it feels odd to just say you will be angry - that’s sort of a wide ranging emotion. Some sort of description of how angry is almost mandatory. You’ll be really angry, or furious, or a little bit angry, or so angry. \n\nSome alternative phrasings that might feel more natural:\n\nFor the first clause:\n\n“If it turns out you didn’t do your homework yesterday”\n\n“If you haven’t done yesterday’s homework”\n\n“If you didn’t actually do your homework yesterday”\n\n“If I find out you didn’t do your homework yesterday”\n\nFor the second clause:\n\n“I’m going to start getting angry”\n\n“I’m going to be furious”\n\n“I’ll start getting cross”\n\nAlso you can flip the clauses and it maybe feels more natural to be less wordy:\n\n“I’ll be angry if you didn’t do your homework yesterday”",

You can say someone is 'punny' if they're good at making puns (combination of pun + funny), but you'd generally 'make puns'. People would likely still understand you using pun as a verb, but it's not really proper.\n\nI don't really have any advice about actually making puns, I'm not very witty either :(",
      "There are websites that generate puns.

      "I think one of the main things is to be aware when a word or combination of words has more than one meaning, *could* take on a different meaning if you changed the context, or sounds (more or less) like something else with a separate meaning. A native speaker might do this unconsciously but you can learn to do it too.\n\nFor example, if you see the idiom \"up to something\" (doing something sneaky), also consider what those words mean literally (i.e., going physically in an upwards direction towards something). Many words/idioms in English either have other meanings or sound like others that have different meanings, though of course not all of these will present obvious opportunities for humour. But the more you think laterally, the more likely you'll be able to notice possibilities.\n\n*Why did 6 fear 7? Because 7 8 9 (seven eight [= sounds like ate] nine).* <-- there are tons of this kind of basic pun based purely on homonyms with different meanings, and they're probably the easiest place to start.",

But perhaps this distinction between wordplay and pun isn't universal.\n\n\nAlso, it's possible that wordplay is not as common in English (at least, in America where I'm from) than it is in your home culture. Based off how my Japanese roommate described Japan, it sounds like wordplay is much more common in Japan than it is in the US.",
      "Make lists of homophones (words that sound the same but mean different things). All you have to do to make a pun is get creative with replacing or combining those words.",

      "I had to think about this a lot, but my reasoning is renditions don’t have to be artful; responses don’t have to be thoughtful; quandaries don’t have to be moral, and humility can’t be haughty, but revenge does have to be vindictive. That leaves consensus as the best option, which doesn’t have to be unanimous, but does at least have to approach it. Saying “unanimous consensus” is essentially a tautology (or close enough) as would be saying “vindictive revenge,” so, I’m going with that one.",
      "I think the last one, Artful Rendition. The definition of \"Vindictive\" means \"prone to revenge\", so it's a pairing of adjective and noun where they both mean the same thing. Haughty and Humility are out because those meanings are contradictory. Consensus, Quandary, and Response are often Unanimous, Moral, or Thoughtful, but they don't have to be.

      "Vindictive (adjective) is to Revenge (noun) as Unanimous (adjective) is to Consensus (noun).\n\nVindictive and Revenge are connected because they both relate to the idea of \"revenge.\" Unanimous and Consensus are connected because the both realte to the idea of \"agreement.\"",
      "I'd pick #4, though I'm not completely comfortable with it. \"Vindictive\" is a feeling, and \"revenge\" is action based on that feeling. #1 is the closest match for the relationship between the two words, but \"unanimous\" is not a feeling. \n\n\"Thoughtful\" is a feeling and \"response\" is an action that could result, so that's a match. I'm not happy with it because while you wouldn't seek revenge without feeling vindictive, you can certainly give a response that's not thoughtful. So to me there are two bad choices, and I picked the one I think is least bad.",
      "Thoughtful is to Response.",
      "I don’t think any of them work.\n\n“Vindictive” is the adjective that describes “revenge”, and they two words are inherently paired. Revenge is by definition a vindictive act. A vindictive act is by definition an act of revenge.\n\n“Unanimous” can describe “consensus”, but not always - a consensus means an agreement, but it may only mean a majority opinion, not a unanimous opinion.\n\n“Haughty” and “humility” are opposites.\n\n“Moral” can describe a “quandary”, but it isn’t the only kind of quandary.\n\n“Thoughtful” can describe a “response”, but it isn’t the only type of response.\n\n“Artful” could describe “rendition”, but it’s not the only type of rendition.\n\nIf I had to pick, I’d pick “unanimous” and “consensus”, but it’s weird because unanimous is not an adjective that inherently describes what consensus means, and vindictive does inherently describe revenge. But, it’s at least fair to say that if there is a decision that is unanimous, there is consensus, even if it’s not true the other way around like is true for vindictive and revenge.",

      "This thread is neither UNANIMOUS nor in CONSENSUS",
      "I lean toward \"thoughtful/response.\"  Vindictive and thoughtful are both states of mind; revenge is an action that can give effect to vindictiveness, and response is an action that can give effect to thoughtfulness.",
      "Ok so vindictive is of someone or something that is prone to or enjoys revenge.\n\n\nA consensus requires a majority but is often unanimous. \n\nHaughty is someone not inclined toward humility. Definitely not that.\n\nA quandary is often moral in nature, but they aren’t innately associated.\n\nA response is often thoughtful, but they aren’t innately associated.\n\nA rendition is innately artistic in nature, but artful would only apply to a good rendition. \n\n\nI think it’s either the first or last. None of these have the exact implications of vengeful and revenge as a pair but those are the closest to that innate pairing. \n\nI lean in favor of artful to rendition, because the ideal form of a rendition is innately artful but I honestly can’t tell. \n\n\nNot to blame test makers for my own shortcomings but with two nearly exact matches like that I do wonder a little if there may have been a mixup with the exact implications of the words on those last two."

In addition to that, many fantasy novels have their own languages that the author uses to create names and even for things that exist in the novel that English has no specific word for (which may not be proper nouns). It's going to vary widely based on author, but you're going to have to keep looking things up.",

The above patterns took me a few months of interacting with them on and off to learn. I've also never met anyone else who wrote or typed like this, and this is new to me, which might be due to my previous experience working mainly with ESL students from Asian backgrounds. \n\nIs this a common pattern amongst English learners from a certain language background? Are there other words that come up like this that I can learn ahead of time so I don't embarrass either me or them?

    "title": "We used to poison you by accident, wiping out all villages with sickness.",
    "text": "In this sentence after the comma sentence started without subject. I need to understand one thing. Does that grammer rule mean;\n\nWe used to poison you by accident [we used to wipe out] all of villages with sickness\n\nOr\n\nWe used to poison you by accident we used to wipe out by giving the wrong thing or sth.\n\nWhat i was trying to ask is that -ing thing is because of deleted subject or something else?\n",
    "comments": [
      "That -ing ending marks the participle, which usually modifies the nearest noun, though in this case I'd say it probably modifies the \"we.\" It turns a noun phrase like \"wipe out all villages . . . \" into a modifier that acts like an adjective. You could think of it as \"We, wiping out all villages with sickness, used to poison you by accident.\" \n\nThat -ing ending can also mark the gerund, which turns a verb phrase into something that acts like a  noun: \"Wiping out entire villages is a morally reprehensible act.\" The two forms are grammatically different, but look exactly the same. You have to figure out which they are by context and the surrounding grammar, and it's something that native speakers sometimes struggle with explaining or recognizing (many English speakers have no idea what a \"gerund\" even is). \n\nSomething about the sentence also feels a little off to my native-speaker intuition, though I can't pin down what's wrong. I think it's that \"wiping out all villages\" sound odd. That doesn't feel like a natural use of \"all.\" I'd expect something like \"wiping out all of your villages\" or \"wiping out every village.\"",
      "So in your example, the \"-ing\" part (\"wiping out...\") is called a **present participle phrase**, and it’s used to describe the result or manner of the main action. Here, it means the poisoning accidentally *caused* the villages to be wiped out. The subject isn’t deleted; it’s just implied to be the same as the main clause (\"we\").\n\nA simpler way to think of it:  \n*\"We poisoned you by accident, \\[and this resulted in\\] wiping out the villages...\"*",
      "A comma isn’t a period. Both clauses have a subject verb agreement.",
      "It’s a participle clause.  Present participle [wiping] means this action has the same subject [we] and happened at the same time as the action in the main clause.  \n“We poisoned you by accident, wiping out all of the villages.”  \n(I wouldn’t use ‘used to’ here).",
      "When you have an -ing verb at the beginning of the second clause like that, pretend there's a \"by\" or \"while\" before the verb: \"we used to poison you by accident [by] wiping out villages with sickness.\" \n\nI would say the adverb is omitted or implied. Either way, the second clause is closely related to the first clause, adding clarity and detail.",
      "The sentence is awkward. It's actually hard to parse without knowing what the speaker/writer was trying to emphasize. In fact, we might say that it's actually grammatically \"wrong\". Also, the \"accidentally\" clashes with a continuing behavior. Better might be:\n\n\"We poisoned you accidentally, wiping out all villages with sickness.\"\n\nThere is an implicit conjunction (I think that's what's missing anyway):\n\n\"We poisoned you accidentally, wiping out all villages with sickness \\[as a result\\].\"\n\nEven better might be:\n\n\"We poisoned you accidentally, and as a result wiped out all villages with sickness.\"\n\nSo, the part after the comma could be an independent clause (the conjunction being implicit) with \"wiping\" as the subject, or it could be a participle phrase that modifies \"to poison\".\n\nBasically, I think the original sentence is a bit sloppy from a grammatical point of view.",
      "Thanks",
      "So you are saying that both of these sentences i wrote is sort of correct?",
      "Thanks that was the answer i was looking for. Grammer books or native speakers don't know how to make me understand these subtle situations because in my language \"by wiping out\" or \" ... , wiping out\" means the same thing. However grammer books say by means of wiping out or by wiping out is verbose.",
      "The first one is closest to being grammatically correct but you would say “all the villages” or just “all villages.”\n\nThe second one has multiple issues that make it sound very jarring."

      "As an English teacher the thing I have found works the best with my students is getting them to watch a YouTube video, write everything they hear even if they can’t understand it or know what word they hear - just write the sound you hear. Do 5-10 seconds of the video at a time and watch each as many times as you need. Then once you’ve got a good chunk done, correct it with your teacher or turn on the subtitles and confirm it. I do that with a few of my students and they’re improving very quickly",
      "Stop treating it as study or homework, just treat it as entertainment, find some podcasts you like, and listen for fun, watch movies for fun, watch YouTube/tik tok/ reels for fun,\n\nDon't stress about understanding every word, just enjoy it",
      "I don't have firsthand experience of learning English as a second language (I'm just a linguistics student), but I would imagine that watching videos with subtitles might be helpful. You could even close your eyes to see how much you're able to follow, and then if you encounter a word or phrase you're unsure of, open them again to check. Listening to videos or audio recordings at a slower speed (like maybe 0.5-0.75x) could help too. I also remember someone telling me once that there are some podcasts made specifically for English learners to practice their listening skills.\n\nThe 'listening wall' is a real phenomenon that second language learners experience. When we are learning our first language as babies, we don't have to worry about reading or writing or memorising complex rules. We just start with talking and listening to sounds. Now that you're learning a new language, you've done it the opposite way around, and your brain gets overwhelmed and confused more easily because it's a bit of an unnatural way to learn. But that's also why practicing speaking and listening is really important. It will help you take advantage of how your brain naturally wants to learn. Plus, listening to native speakers will also help you improve your accent, even if you don't completely understand every word.\n\nAlso, try to take some of the pressure off of yourself. Like another commenter said, it's ok if you miss words sometimes while you're learning. Try to find TV shows or other forms of media that you actually enjoy, and have fun. Stressing less will actually help you improve faster. \n\nGood luck and I hope you get a lot more helpful advice!",
      "Instead of \"studying,\" I just listen to tons of English podcasts and audiobooks every day. \n\nAt the beginning, I felt native speakers spoke way too fast to understand, but now I can understand them even when they speak quickly. Sometimes, I even need to increase the playback speed for YouTube videos to save time.\n\nMy listening comprehension has improved a lot, and I can understand American English pretty well. However, I sometimes still struggle with the British accent. I have British friends, and I probably should hang out with them more often!",
      "Maybe just need more time. To me, beside the vocabulary limitation, I did not see a wall. I watch a lot of Youtube videos everyday,  I can see my listening skill keeps improving, now for the educational content, news and vlogs, I can easily follow with 1.75+ speed. For real life conversation, I do not have any problem to follow. But 3 years ago, it was different, I found it hard to even catch the general meaning of a lecture.

      "I’m a native English speaker. Not sure if this will help but watch YouTube videos with captions and speed the video up and watch it. See if you can understand it and keep speeding it up until you understand it. I’m able to almost perfect understand videos that are 3.7x its normal speed.",
      "I faced similar problems - I studied English at school and it was ok-ish. I could have a simple conversation but I was not able to understand TV shows, YouTube videos, etc. \n\nI thought I plateaued in my progress but I was able to improve my skills tremendously over 2 years by teaching myself. \n\nHere is some advice that I would recommend, based on my own experience (so please don’t tell me *”this is not how you should study English”* - it worked for me and I am positive that it will work for others)\n\n1- 45 min of grammar per day seems a bit excessive. Yes, grammar is important, but English is not so complex that it requires this much grammar exercise. I would reduce it to 30 min per WEEK. Use the time you save to *listen* and *speak* more and also learn idioms. \n\n2- What helped me improve my understanding of spoken English was watching videos and series with subtitles. And I don’t sit back and relax - I actually read the subtitles. If their spoken words don’t match the subtitles, I rewatch the scene over and over again until I understand what they are saying. \n\n3- don’t watch complicated stuff, like business podcasts as you mentioned in your post. Watch something that you actually enjoy. Baking videos, make up tutorials, reality tv etc. \n\n4- learning vocabulary and grammar with worksheets will only improve your skills by 5%. The remaining 95% come from using it in conversations. You need to be able to use grammar rules without thinking about it. \n\n5- And you need to speak way way way more. 1 hour per week doesn’t scratch the surface. What helped me: I became interested in gaming and was forced to join discord servers to play multiplayer games. But even if you’re not into gaming, I am certain that there are dc servers that connect you with native speakers to practise speaking. \n\n6- when you make a native speaker friend eventually, tell them to point out mistakes that you make while speaking. \n\n7- immerse yourself in this language. Set your phone and pc to English. Watch YouTube in English. Write grocery lists in English. Talk to your cat in English. (Yes I am serious) \n\n8- I know it’s not always possible, but get a job where you’re forced to speak English. \n\n9- when you select a tv show to watch, make sure it’s an American show. Their accents seem to be easier to understand for beginners. I made the mistake of watching a British show and all of them had a scouse accent which is hard to understand for inexperienced listeners. \n\n10- Time. It won’t come overnight. It took me 2 years to get from a high school level English to being very confident in my abilities.",

      "What activities, resources, or books do you use to study reading and vocabulary?",
      "That \"listening wall\" is real, especially with fast, natural speech. What helped me was focusing on narrow listening—repeating the same podcast or interview multiple times. First with subtitles, then audio-only, and finally at a slower speed before going back to normal. It trains your ear gradually.\n\nAlso, try to listen actively even during chores: pick one speaker you like and stick with their voice until it becomes familiar.",

They're higher in the throat or closer to the front of the mouth than most Americans pronounce them, a bit like the way they're pronounced in French. When I try to mimic them, I put the back of my tongue close to the back of the roof of my mouth, somewhat closing off my throat. The way I pronounce *r* myself, on the other hand, has the tip of my tongue curled upwards toward but not touching the middle of the roof of my mouth. It produces a deeper *r* than yours. To practice, yoiu might try pretending to growl like a dog (though I know different languages represent dog sounds differently).\n\nHope that helps.",
      "I wonder if you can contact someone that's an actual expert in vocalization. I can definitely hear your accent, but other than play around with the sounds in my own mouth, I don't really know how to explain how to get closer to \"American English\" (whatever that is :) ). Or maybe there are places where actors learn accents. Or some sort of accent coach? FWIW, I didn't have any trouble understanding you. \n\nAnd I know you're focused on the accent, but if you were also interested in idioms and vocabulary, maybe that would be easier for folks here to help with. I know that Indian coworkers of mine make specific vocabulary choices that I sometimes have to ponder for a bit. (I'm assuming this is Indian English, apologies if I've mislabeled insensitively.)",

      "Your “th”s need work. I did stop listening at “although” so I’m not sure what else to point out to you. But you should definatly try and work on making your “th”s sound less like a “d”. When making a “d” sound your tongue touches the roof of your mouth. You can practice with the word “though” but your tongue should never touch the roof of your mouth when saying “though”. It gets pressed against the bottom of your upper teeth and then air gets passed between your tongue and your teeth making an almost lower, for lack of a better word, hissing noise.",

      "Honestly, I have spoken with natives, and they have no trouble understanding me. But the accent kind of bothers me, and that's why I want to work on it. But I also see your point that it is much harder to work on something you are not born with, aka the native accent. Though I am sure there must be a way to learn it.

    "comments": [
      "\"I will get used to\" emphasises the process of improving and adapting to the difference (e.g. \"I am not great at it right now, but I will get used to driving on the right\"), whereas \"I will be used to\" seems as if it's more in reference to a specific time frame (e.g. \"in two months, I will be used to driving on the right\"). The first one basically refers to the process, whereas the second one refers to the thing happening by a certain point.",
      "The first focuses on the process of becoming accustomed.  The second focuses on the result - it will be normal.",
      "Out of the two, ‘I’ll be used to driving on the right’ sounds strange.",
      "So from what I understand, there is a small difference!\n\n* \"I will get used to driving on the right\" → means you're still in the process of adapting (like you're actively learning/practicing)\n* \"I'll be used to driving on the right\" → means at some future point, it'll already feel normal to you\n\nKinda like \"I will get tired\" vs \"I will be tired\" if that makes sense?",
      "\"I'll be used to\" is close to future perfect tense (with a notion of continuation). I suppose the true future perfect tense would be \"I will have gotten used to\", but that might be quibbling. \"I will get used to\" is just simple future tense describing an ongoing activity occurring in the future. Both of these sound awkward out of context. In real world use, either of these sentences would probably have some emphasis added to specific words to clarify the intent in context.",
      "Both sentences are a little awkward but if you understand the difference between get used to and be used to, I'm not sure what else to say.\n\n\nBeing used to something is the end result of getting used to it.\n\n\nEdit: Thinking about it for a few more seconds, there are some examples where the practical difference is close to zero. \"I'm still not totally comfortable in front of a classroom, but I'm sure I'll [be used to / get used to / have gotten used to] it by next year.\"",
      "The first one is stand alone.  \nThe second one is incomplete without a clause telling when it will happen, unless you are answering a question about your driving in the future  \n\"…, by my driving test\" - \"… soon\" \"… before it's time for our road trip\"",
      "The second one at least implies, if not explicitly accompanied by, a condition that will cause you to become used to driving on the right. ",
      "'used to driving on the right' is just an adjectival phrase; you can replace it with any other adjective, describing some state that can apply to yourself:\n\n\"I am excited\", \"I am bored of waiting\", \"I am used to driving on the right\"\n\nNow, this condition that applies to you; we might want to talk about how it applies to you at a particular moment - in which case we'll use 'to be' in some tense:\n\nPast: \"I was excited\", \"I was bored of waiting\", \"I was used to driving on the right\"  \nPresent: \"I am excited\", \"I am bored of waiting\", \"I am used to driving on the right\"  \nFuture: \"I will be excited\", \"I will be bored of waiting\", \"I will be used to driving on the right\"\n\nOr, this condition, you might want to talk about how you are transitioning into a state of having it apply to you at a particular moment. In which case we'll use another verb - maybe 'become', 'get', or perhaps 'grow' if the transition's more gradual.\n\nPast: \"I became excited\", \"I got bored of waiting\", \"I grew used to driving on the right\"  \nPresent: \"I become excited\", \"I get bored of waiting\", \"I grow used to driving on the right\"  \nFuture: \"I'll become excited\", \"I'll get bored of waiting\", \"I'll grow used to driving on the right\"\n\n(I used the same verb for each adjectival phrase in each tense, but you can mix them up - you can grow excited, or get used to driving on the right too)\n\nSo - to be, you're describing how at a particular time the condition applies; to become, to get or to grow, you're describing how at a particular time you transition into the condition.\n\nNow, advanced mode:\n\n\"getting <adjective phrase>\" (or becoming, or growing) is itself *an adjective phrase.* It describes the condition of 'being in the process of acquiring the condition\".\n\nSo, you can \"be getting excited\".\n\nAnd we can be in the process of acquiring a condition, in the past, present or future:\n\nPast: \"I was becoming excited\", \"I was getting bored of waiting\", \"I was growing used to driving on the right\"  \nPresent: \"I am becoming excited\", \"I am getting bored of waiting\", \"I am growing used to driving on the right\"  \nFuture: \"I will be becoming excited\", \"I will be getting bored of waiting\", \"I will be growing used to driving on the right\"\n\nWhich give you continuous versions of the same 'process of acquiring the condition' state, for where the transition is ongoing, and at the moment in question the process has started and not yet completed.\n\nAnd you can keep on layering the tenses until you're saying: \"Well by next year I will have been getting used to driving on the right for six months\"",

      "\"I'll get used to driving on the right\" means \"I will become accustomed to...\"\n\n\"I'll be used to driving...\" is not correct\n\n\"I used to drive on the right\" means \"I don't drive on the right anymore, I drive on the left\" (someone who moved to England for example).",
      "Also worth noting that the 1st one is pretty common whereas you don’t hear the 2nd one much. It would be correct and mean the same thing to say “become used to,” but “get used to” is the common, natural sounding form of the phrase.",

I wouldn't beat yourself up about this - most native speakers would struggle with this.\n\nEdit: the reason for (4) is that in the latter part of the text it has started to talk about things that seem like common experiences. It acknowledges that experts might disagree to some extent but (4) then says that the commonalities outweigh the differences.",

The writer limits the scope of the text to the basic characteristics of music which are consistently perceived- ‘I am concerned here … relatively consistent across listeners.”  \nThe final 3 lines are a concession - some differences do exist - the missing sentence is the concluding sentence that provides the argument to complete the concession structure “but … the communalities outweighs the differences.”  This a feature of academic discourse:\nState your argument.  Concede some evidence against your argument.  Conclude that despite this, the original argument is correct.",

As a native English speaker with a Law degree (I only say that to say I’ve read a lot of convoluted texts), this is written in a very very academic way. It’s frustrating to read and totally turns me off from the text if I’m not deeply interested in the subject, and requires pretty active attention to fully grasp what the author is saying through, at least, the first half of the text. The second half is a bit easier, but it’s still, I feel, poorly written but for in academic circles.\n\nEffectively it’s saying that we can’t generalise musical interpretations. If we want to think about how someone might perceive a piece of music, it’s important to first figure out who is actually listening to the music. It starts with what culture are they part of, where are they from, but even if you account for that then you need to understand what level of education they have in music and how that changes their interpretation of it.\n\nTo me, like most academic texts, it’s a whole lot of words to say “it depends”, which is why academic texts are so frustrating to read most of the time\n\nEdit: I think the answer is 3",

There is no 100% guarantee that everyone will always agree on those objective qualities, but typically, most opinions tend towards alignment.\n\n\n\nThe only context in my experience where English is used in this way is in reading theses for Masters/Doctorate level writing. Even academic journals are not usually this dull and abstruse.",
      "It's pseuo-academic gobbledygook.",
      "My analysis: the piece as a whole is analyzing musical perception, and how much differences in that perception exist. For each statement: 1 is describing an active plan to reduce those differences, which isn't evident. It also sounds slightly ungrammatical to me in the context of the whole. Emerge from what? 2. Nothing in the piece is describing the actions of communities or the *evolution* of their musical behaviors, just whether differences exist 3. The piece also isn't saying that varied perceptions are better or enriching, just that they exist to some extent. 5. Also sounds somewhat ungrammatical. Again, counts for what?\n\n4. Is the best. \"But\" sets up that the sentence is going to contrast the previous one, which is talking about disagreement in perception, and 4. is talking about how the commonalities outweigh \"the differences\", which ties directly to the previous sentence. The opening follows a similar structure: it starts with saying, yes there are differences in music perception, BUT almost everyone can find a beat. Yes, experts may have disagreements, BUT there are more commonalities than differences. 4. fits in best with the previous sentence and the thrust of the entire paragraph.",

Now I am ready to take on some more complicated work.\n\nExperienced Problems\n\nThe main dificulty for me was getting the proper testing data to check my achieved work.

First, I would like to develop more skills in writing testcode, in this way I can automatically test my work. Second, I would like to get to know the environment in which the software runs, the users, the domain. I hope that I can attribute to the functional specifications of the software, not only the technical implementation.\n\nFinally I would like to give my appreciation for all the help you have given me this period.

I think I might be very scatterbrained? When I try to write or speak so many images are in my head at once and I always stutter or have to change up the entire structure of the sentence. To give an example, even writing a simple diary entry in my native language will take me at least 1 hour, if I want to structure sentences properly. I’m literally 20 too, so no excuses.\n\nBut it’s also true that I’m slightly better at my native language than English. Also the way I make my sentences in English is different from how a native speaker would do it so that’s another thing I want to overcome. Oh and when I stutter it makes my pronunciation all weird and I don’t like that. It could just be getting worse due to me not speaking english though\n\nSo I have three questions for you:\n1. Which of the two in the title do you think is my bigger problem? As in the thing I need to focus on more.\n2. Regardless of the answer for Q#1, I wanna get my English to a fluent level. Do you think starting with a grammar textbook is a good choice? After that I’m planning to straight out just transcribe books, multiple times until I almost memorize it.\n3.

      "Hey! First of all, don’t stress too much, your English is actually really good from what I can see here! 😊 I totally get the frustration though. I’ve had moments where I feel like my speaking/writing just locks up even though my comprehension is fine.\n\nFor your first question, it sounds like your main struggle is **output** (speaking/writing) rather than input (reading/listening). That’s super common, especially if you’re not using English actively every day. The \"scatterbrained\" feeling when trying to form sentences? Relatable. 😅 I’ve found that practicing with shorter, simpler sentences first helps then slowly building up complexity.\n\nGrammar textbooks can help, but imo, they’re not the most fun or efficient way to improve fluency. Transcribing books is a cool idea though! Maybe try journaling in English too, even just a few sentences a day? It’s low-pressure and helps organize thoughts.\n\nFor pronunciation, it’s definitely not hopeless! Shadowing (repeating audio right after you hear it) has helped me a ton. "

That's true.\n\nSometimes I think even when the CAE test were in Dutch I would make mistakes. Especially when I would not prepare myself. But they sent me some example material, and I got a better understanding of what they want now. \n\nIt's also that for similar tests at Alliance Française and Goethe Institute I did not really prepare myself either, and passed those test easily, with no idea how it would be examined. That was on a different level though B2, not C1. I took the same approach with Cambridge C1, because I consider myself better at English then at French or German. But when I now go through some preparation material, I am unpleasantly surprised.\n\nI still think I can pass, but it's not as easy as I thought it would be. Pfff.",
      "Well when I search for it:\n\n\"Done in a breeze\" is an idiom that means something was accomplished easily and without difficulty. It implies that the task was simple, quick, and perhaps surprisingly so. \n\n[https://www.collinsdictionary.com/dictionary/english/in-a-breeze](https://www.collinsdictionary.com/dictionary/english/in-a-breeze)\n\n\\---\n\n[https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/rattle](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/rattle)\n\nto chatter incessantly and aimlessly?\n\nI meant to babble, rave, jabber, twaddle?\n\n\\---\n\ninclination - tendency may be then?\n\nIn Dutch neiging but maybe not the right word here?\n\n[https://www.mijnwoordenboek.nl/vertaal/NL/EN/neiging](https://www.mijnwoordenboek.nl/vertaal/NL/EN/neiging)\n\nI guess this is betten then\n\nIk heb de neiging - I tend / I have the tendency / I am inclined\n\n\\---\n\nAnd probe exam, is probably a far too Dutch translation of proefexamen. :)\n\nOkay noted, that should, mock exam, train exam. Maybe test exam?\n\nAdded it to the word list\n\nBut thank you for any comment.",
      "“I am kind of warned now” is another error in your writing. It doesn’t feel natural to me as a native speaker at all. “I am forewarned now” could fit better or perhaps omit that part altogether.\n\nAlso, “I have the inclination of” is not right. Usually the correct preposition with incline is “to”. E.g. I am inclined to believe. Here I would say “I am inclined to write to write too much and too fast.”\n\nNot trying to nitpick here, I just wanted to help point out where you could improve. Hope it helps!",
      "Sorry only just seen this part now, after replying above. I’ve never heard “done in a breeze”. The idiom that comes to mind for me is “it was a breeze” meaning it was very easy.\n\n“To rattle about” is not quite right either. You can say “I rattled on about (something)” or just being more general you can say “I was rattling on”.\n\nI covered the “I am inclined” above, but yes that is much better structure to achieve what you are saying.",
      "As another poster pointed out - the meaning you want is rattle on - not rattle about.  Different preposition, different meaning.  \nHave an inclination to, not have an inclination of - preposition again.  \nSomething was done in a breeze, not “I” was done in a breeze."

    "text": "Hi. This is my first post on this platform, English is my second language (B1 level), so my vocabulary, grammar skills aren’t the best and I make a lot of mistakes. My problem with learning English are my difficult experiences from the past. \n\nI’m on the third year of studies at the University. I had an English lectures and I were in more advanced group were every person had no problems with listening, speaking and doing exercises compare with grammar and vocabulary topics. I was the weakest person in my group and my teacher knew that, so she started to be passive aggressive to me and she bullied me. When I  had a presentation and speaked in front of my group, she non stop correct my mistakes and thanks to that I was forgetting a meaning of my speech and what can I say later. She was judging my English saying :ok, Mr Adam, sorry but you got a worse note again. My final note were bad and I had a threat to pass, so she commented this situation saying: Adam not deserve to take part the exam, like other people with better notes. She said this in front of my group and i felt devastated, and humiliated. \n\nAfter that, luckily I passed the finish exam, but I felt have a downgrade. I realized that I have to change this and improve my English, because not knowing this language is like have a body without an arm, in world when we are surrounding this culture (music, movies, memes etc.). My mental was focused on English like a school subject, and I wasn’t watch movies, series because I looked for translations on my native language. So I started watching series, movies because I tried thinking about English as something pleasant, interesting and giving me happiness. But this is really hard, because when I don’t understand a word, meaning of simple sentence or stop trying to translate to my native language, I remembering my traumas, hide back on my mind. I feel frustration and I want to cry.\n\nI don’t really know what can I do. I would like to change my perspective but it’s really difficult.

It sounds like what you might need is a low-stress, friendly environment to build that confidence back up. I know people are often posting discord groups to the sub that are open to learners and where you will be with learners of all different levels. I would take a look at those and see if you can find one that you like so that you can get some practice in in a way that won’t make you too nervous.",

English is my native language, but I am certainly aware of the peculiarities you encounter trying to increase fluency beyond B1.\nKeep at it. Don’t let a bad experience with this professor discourage you from reaching your goals. You are already most of the way there.\nI do have one suggestion. You mention watching series and movies in English, but it can be hard when you encounter words you don’t know. I’d recommend watching a series or movie you are already familiar with—preferably one you’ve watched multiple times—in English because the words you don’t know are easier to understand contextually in a story you already know.\nRegardless, don’t be too hard on yourself. You are doing more mental work to understand your lessons than most of your classmates. Take care of yourself along the way too.",
      "Hey Adam, I'm really sorry you went through such a negative experience with your teacher. Their behavior says more about their lack of empathy than your abilities. Everyone learns at their own pace, and making mistakes is *how* we learn.\n\nIt’s amazing that you’ve already started to shift your mindset, like watching series and movies in English. If you're finding it hard not to translate everything, tools like FluentU might really help. It uses real-world videos like music videos, movie clips, and interviews, and shows you subtitles with word meanings right there, so you’re not constantly stopping to look things up (I've used it for years and now I help them with some admin staff too). You can also try Language Reactor (works with Netflix and YouTube) — it gives you dual subtitles and lets you click on words for instant translations and explanations. Both tools help your brain slowly connect English directly with meaning, without needing to go through your native language all the time.\n\nAnd don't be afraid to enjoy things even if you don’t understand everything at first. Understanding builds over time. \n\nFinally, you absolutely deserve to learn English in a way that makes you feel respected and supported. You’re not alone—many people have had to rebuild their confidence after bad school experiences. You *can* do this, step by step.\n\nSending you lots of encouragement! 🌟",

      "A tip for retaining words: If you encounter a word in a book or movie you don't know, stop and look it up. Even if you don't remember the definition initially, you will after you look the same word up a few times. Having the action of looking the word up attached to the word helps remember the meaning. Wiktionary is a good resource, it has words in many many languages, both modern and ancient and it often includes outdated, dialectal, and other lesser used meanings that many dictionaries omit so when you occasionally find a word where the context doesn't make sense with any of the usual definitions it will help a lot. The only thing it's not great for is internet slang.\n\n\nIf you have trouble remembering the meanings of words still, write them down with their definitions and maybe some example sentences and that will help you absorb it.",

      "‘(Be) on one’ is an elegant and versatile phrase from informal British English.  It could have any number of meanings, all dependent on the context and shared understanding between speakers.  \n\nIn more detail:   In English, native speakers often prefer a preposition phrase to an adjective or adverb.  \nSo, instead on ‘timely’ - ‘on time’.  Instead of ‘topical’ - ‘on topic’ etc.  \n\nThese can use any preposition, not just ‘on’.  Some of the meanings can be quite idiomatic.  ‘Under the table’ for example, can describe the position of something, or it can describe something (especially a payment) which is done covertly or secretly.  \n\nIn informal spoken English, there are many phrases with ‘on + noun phrase’ which describe activities / states in progress:\n\nOn a bender - drinking a lot\nOn a promise - with a promise of sex later\nOn a pill - after having taken an illegal drug like ecstasy.\nOn a break - in the process of having a break (perhaps from a relationship)\nOn a streak / on a roll - having a period of good luck.  \nEtc.  \non a rampage - moving around in a wild, uncontrolled and destructive way.\nOn a rant - speaking in an impassioned and angry way.  \n\nIn English, ‘one’ can be used to substitute for a countable noun:\nA:  “Do you have a spare pen.”  \n\nB:  yeah\n\nA:  “Can you give me one.”  (One = spare pen)\n\nNotice that the noun referred to is dependent on the context.  \n\nThus \n“I’m on one” can mean any of these prepositional phrases which contains a countable noun.  \n\nIt often means “on a rampage’ - in the course of violent, destructive behaviour.  “He’s gone off on one.”  (He is in the course of another period of violent, destructive behaviour.\n\nOr it often means “on a bender” - in the course of a drinking / partying / drugs binge.  “It’s Friday night, let’s get on one!”  \n\nIt all depends on the shared understanding between the speakers.  With one friend, if I said “I’m on one” it would mean drinking a lot.  With another, it would mean I am in the mood to talk about something with passion and anger.  \n\nThis makes it very versatile.  \n\nYou need to examine the context to figure out what your song means.",
      "Your definition sounds right but I couldn't find a relevant dictionary entry. None of the examples in your free dictionary link use the literal word \"one\".\n\nI've definitely heard this expression though. I tried to search in COCA for idiomatic usage examples but that didn't help as there are so many irrelevant usages where \"one\" is just used as an determiner like in \"he 's on one of his personal missions\".",

      "If you downvoting this, you should do one.",
      "What you said is a good example,\n\n> \"He's on one of his personal missions\"\n\nIt implies that he often goes on missions, and he is currently doing a mission.\n\nIt's usually hyperbole. Exaggeration.\n\nHe - maybe your friend - often gets fixated on a \"mission\" - which might be getting fit, or beating a computer game, or green energy or Thai cooking... anything from the mundane to the extreme. Such things can be described as \"a mission\", and some people tend to become somewhat obsessed by that one thing.\n\nSo... if a person is like that - susceptible to doing \"missions\" - it can be shortened to saying \"He's on one\". It's saying that his current activities are typical of his behavioural pattern, because he often becomes fixated on one thing.\n\nBut people also become fixated on drinking, or taking drugs, \"going on a bender\" - and that is also often described as being \"on one\".\n\nOr even someone who has a strong opinion, and sometimes rants about it. Like... say, somebody who hates Trump. They're normally perfectly nice to chat to, but sometimes they start ranting about politics and injustice and immigration and ... they're \"on one\".\n\nIt's *usually* used in a negative sense. \"Ignore John; he's on one today\".\n\nHe is on one of his regular tirades or extreme behaviours.\n\nI hope you can understand that the two uses are directly related.\n\nI don't know which one the singer intends; I can only speculate.\n\nThink of it as \"on one of those rants\" that he often goes on. One of many. Some type of abnormal behaviour which is recurrent for him. Drinking, arguing, obsessing... it's almost always negative."

      "\"...on your <verb>ing\" is an uncommon construction, but I see it once in awhile.\n\nI think \"...on you telling me the truth\" would be grammatically correct, but a bit awkward. \"I insist that you tell me the truth\" would be more natural.",
      "The pronoun \"you\" could work, and it’s what most people would say in this context nowadays.\n\nBut the more accurate pronoun to use would be \"your,\" which is in the possessive case. The reason for this is that the thing that is being insisted on is the person's act of telling the truth, not the person themself.\n\nBut once again, this construction with the possessive case is hardly used nowadays as it can sound stilted and formal. To avoid it, people typically use the objective case (\"you\") or just rephrase the sentence, like so:\n\n\"As your lawyer, I insist that you tell me the truth.\"",
      "It's a fancy way of saying something like \"I insist on your cooperation\" vs. \"I insist on you cooperating\" vs. \"I insist that you cooperate.\"\n\nLikewise, \"I insist on your paying attention\" and \"I insist you paying attention\" and \"I insist you pay attention.\"\n\nThe idea is that there's an intangible thing that is \"telling the truth\" and that it belongs to you. And that person is insisting you give that \"telling the truth\" to him.",
      "This is --to me-- correct, but somewhat stilted English. The construction you're looking for, and that I would write, is \"I insist that you tell me the truth.\" You can't really 'insist on' a person in this sense, you would instead insist on someone *doing* a thing, in this case \"telling the truth\". The meaning is slightly different though, as there's some ambiguity my way whether or not the person tell the truth in just this one instance rather than from that point forward. The way it's written above strongly implies the latter. An important distinction for a lawyer, but not very natural sounding to a layperson.",
      "Either one is fine. \n\nI insist on you telling me the truth is more informal. \n\nI insist on your telling me the truth is more formal. It’s possibly also more British but then as an American that may just be that I associate these more elegant structures with Standard British English.",

      "Using \"your\" is the only correct version of the sentence.\n\nThe reason is that \"the truth\" belongs to the person. Telling (with the \"ing\" suffix) is a gerund, or a verb used as a noun.\n\nSo, the sentence places importance on telling the truth.\n\nWhen you place a pronoun before a gerund, the action belongs to the person who needs to tell the truth. That means the pronoun requires a possessive form. Thus, \"your\" is the only acceptable word to use.",

      "\"guise ... sabotage\". There are a limited number of words that will ever fit idiomatically into the phrase \"under the \\_ of\". Unfortunately, this particular example isn't very useful if you're trying to learn English. The word \"guise\" isn't used frequently, you may never hear it used outside of \"under the guise of\" or \"in the guise of\". In other constructs, you'd probably be more likely to use \"disguise\". Also, \"sabotage their grades\" is kind of shorthand. It's definitely understandable, but it's not aligned perfectly with the meaning of \"sabotage\". Grades are an output of some effort/plan, and so you can't really sabotage grades (well, unless you had access to the grade database, I guess). You can sabotage the effort to do something. For example, you could sabotage their study session by turning off the air conditioning (if they're studying in summer), which would make it harder for them to study because the heat would be uncomfortable. What \"sabotage their grades\" really means is \"sabotage their effort to get good grades\".",

      "Depends on the game I suppose. I'd say to an extent. Deltarune is a pretty quirky game and has multiple over the top characters with various quirks. Most of it would be fine for learning I imagine, but some of those quirks could trip you up a bit.",

Yet for video games the reverse is true. \n\n\nRarely do video games get normal modern human interaction right. The Last of Us 1 and 2 does pretty good but still has its cringe moments. ",

      "**The short answer**\n\nI think the Deltarune developer is a strong writer. I haven't played that game beyond the first chapter years ago, but I just did Undertale. Its dialogue is very strong and readable. It does sound like very natural speech in English.\n\n**The longer answer**\n\nGenerally speaking, the answer is \"kind of.\" Language in RPGs, and much fiction, are often \"heightened\" and stylized to some degree and even get stuff wrong. For example, fiction in \"medieval\"-seeming settings ape but hardly replicate early modern English, and they don't even touch \"old English\" or \"Middle English,\" which can seem like foreign languages compared to the modern version.\n\nEven \"realistic\" and modern stories may take liberties with the language. In another example, Cyberpunk 2077 is peppered with fictionalized slang terms like \"choom\" and \"corpo.\" With that said, I'm fairly certainly I've see people online use the term \"corpo\" from time to time, probably under the influence of that game.\n\nEDIT: Clarifying text.",
      "Really depends.\n\nPeople can fumble their sentences, be repetitive, use filler words, etc. a lot more. Actors can also be saying their lines multiple times for the director, but only the best take is used in the final product.

Or if too many people repeat questions because the recipient didn’t hear correctly?",

      "\"Began\" sounds too formal in that usage, but it works. I think \"I started writing...\" or \"I started to write...\" would be much more common. \"Called\" works fine in a lot of constructions in place of \"titled\" or \"named\", but since you're writing the novel, I think \"titled\" is actually better here. (I'm referring to American English here, I hear \"called\" a lot more frequently in British English.) As for the hyphenated \"English-language\", that's just a special construction to make an adjective phrase when the individual words don't stand on their own as adjectives. So, you can't write a \"language novel\", but you can write an \"English-language novel\". But it's not required, and a lot of people would consider it an unnecessary affectation. I.e. \"English language novel\" is fine. Also, \"English novel\" could be interpreted as \"novel set in England\" or \"novel written by an English author\".",

    "title": "What is “軽音楽部” in English?",
    "text": "Perhaps someone has already posted a similar question, but please allow me to ask because this is my long-standing question.\n\nWhat is “軽音楽部” in English?\n\nI found translations such as “light music club” and “modern music club”, “bands music club” and so on, but in the end, I don’t know which is the most correct.\n\nI posted this because I want to get real opinions since I’m using reddit. Finally, I apologize that my sentence maybe wrong and asking a strange question.\n\nThanks in advance!",
    "comments": [
      "こんばんは~\n\n\nWhat you’re referring to is usually just called a high school music club/band in English since a 軽音楽部(kei-ongaku-bu) is pretty much only a thing in Japan. \n\n\nNon-Japanese high school music clubs usually perform classical music in the form of an orchestra, so you’ll have to specify that a 軽音部 is more akin to a modern band. \n\n\nWhile “light music” does exist, it sounds poorly translated in this context (but not in the form of wasei-eigo), the English equivalent would be “pop music”.\n\n\nEdit: [This YouTube Channel](https://youtube.com/@jeunesse5463?si=EBI-vjUvxqPYS9Va) is a great example for those interested.",
      "Could you explain what exactly it is? Like what the people do? “Light music club” is not a term I’m familiar with. You might be having trouble translating it because it seems to be more of a Japanese cultural thing?",
      "It's translated as light music club, but without context, it would not make sense to English speakers. You can describe it as \"non classical music school club\"",
      "This meaning of \"light music\" seems very broad. The (translated from Japanese) wikipedia page tells me it can mean anything other than classical music, which covers a lot of genres. \n\nIf you want to speak of your own experience, I'd suggest figuring out the best English word to describe the particular genre you play. Then say something like \"I'm in a school band that plays [that genre] music.\"",
      "From your description I'd say \"extracurricular band.\" We don't tend to use the word club when it comes to music groups.",
      "Based on how others are describing it, you’d probably just call it “band” and then explain what it is if necessary for the context. “I have band after school” gets across that you’re doing a club based around playing music, but doesn’t specify genre, so that would have to be explained. I don’t think there’s a more specific term for what you’re describing.",
      "\"Light music\" is the name of the music style. In the US, we don't make a distinction between \"light music\" and orchestra music in our club names. Usually, we simply call the club \"band\". Like: \"I'm in band, so I have to play in the pep rally.\"\n\nI called it a club just now, but it's typically a class that students can choose to take: \"band class\". Students have a designated instrument they each play. The class will meet 3 or 5 times a week, and will meet for performances outside class time.\n\nThe type of music they play would likely be considered \"light music\". Band usually isn't considered very seriously.",
      "Based on the other comments explaining what the term you’re speaking of means: \n\nIs it possible you’re looking for the English term ’Glee Club’?",
      "My high school had a band program, and then separately a \"rock band\" program, where students learned drums, guitar, bass, and vocals. I've heard of other similar programs where they learn recording techniques. Is it similar to that?",
      "As far as I know, this is a Japan-specific club activity. The club members form a band and perform at cultural festivals and such.",
      "A Glee Club is more like a school choir. Japanese high school bands use contemporary instruments like electric guitars and drum sets.",
      "The rock band thing sounds spot on if it wasn’t focused on learning, the Japanese ones are more like the students practising on their own. I’ve added a YouTube link so that people can visualise what it’s like.",
      "It might translate as band, then. If it's a specific genre of music that they're playing, then [genre] band.\n\n\nMy high school had a school sponsored jazz band, marching band, and a band class, and some students formed their own bands outside school to play whatever they liked for fun. ",
      "So like band class? (Or maybe more specifically: modern band)",
      "It’s similar to band class, just without the trumpets, trombones and such. \n\n\nI did mention modern bands as an example in my other comment.\n\n\n[This YouTube Channel](https://youtube.com/@jeunesse5463?si=EBI-vjUvxqPYS9Va) was created by some high schoolers in Japan. In a nutshell, the “music club” is basically just a bunch of students doing band practice."

      "Sometimes people refer to boats/trains/cars as “she”. But never a woman.",
      "Calling vehicles female is a personal affection thing. It's more for referring to your own vehicle (be it a car, train, boat, bike) in a loving way. \"This is my old car. She's a classic beaut\". The other scenario is personification in stories.",
      "Yes and no.\n\nAn inanimate object is never called a \"woman.\" But... because American English is so varied:\n\n\n\n\"This little lady can go from 0 to 60mph in 4 seconds flat!\" when talking about a car\n\n\"She's been steaming ever since 1906\" when talking about a boat\n\n\"That girl's been my pride and joy ever since I first bought her in high school\" (talking about a car, in this case)",
      "No. Referring to vehicles as \"she\" is a thing (not super common, at least not any more) but it doesn't extend to referring to said vehicles as girls or women.",
      "This looks like a page from \"The Little Engine that Could\". If so, the train can talk and has a personality, and so can be gendered.",
      "I can see how it would make sense since we call them \"she\" sometimes but I've ever heard anyone do that, native speaker or learner. It could be interesting to use in a poetic/literary context where we personify things all the time, but I think it would be confusing outside of that.",
      "When anthropomorphize any object, I do tend to use lady as it is a little bit more formal. In this case, you can call the train any of those you want, a girl, a lady or a woman would all technically be correct. Many earlier vessels were called with it because men would stay on them for months at a time. This isn’t quite the issue it used to be.",
      "I mean, ot looks like there is a face on it, meaning the train has human characteristics. If it has a name as well, I would not think twice about it if you referred to it as a girl.",
      "I woudnt know what you were referring to if you said that",
      "It appears this is an anthropomorphic train, and as such, she can have a gender",
      "Not really. There’s the thing where cars/boats ect are sometimes called she as some form of endearment, (”she runs and drives like a dream!”) but that’s not at all what’s going on in the illustration. \n\nThis looks like the book The Little Engine That Could, so there are male and female gendered train characters in this book. Thinking of lots of other books or shows, it’s rare for the characters to be called anything (woman, lady, girl) despite having been assigned gender pronouns and characteristics. Somehow Thomas the Train is a “he” but he’s not a boy train or man train, just a train. You *could* say it, but it seems odd. \n\n“This book is about a girl train” sounds the least awkward, with “next they ask a man train for help” being the most awkward. Maybe that’s because a lot of the time characterizing/anthropomorphizing objects happens most commonly in kids' media. Kids’ stories often have child characters, and children often call even grown adults “boys/girls” so maybe that’s why calling a object character “man” or “woman” sounds so strange.\n\n\nAlso if you say just “girl” or “woman” etc. without some context, people will always assume you mean a human. If you said “the girl in this book” I would wonder what in the world you're talking about because it’s about a train. “The main character is a girl train” makes sense albeit still weird over just saying “train”",
      "Some people do gender objects in English (boats, cars, trains, musical instruments, some other things might be called she/her, although nobody calls them women, because they aren’t women). \n\nBut keep in mind that this book was written in 1930. Attitudes towards women and gender in general have shifted for many people in the almost 100 years since then, so it may seem funny, quaint, sexist, weird, or just obsolete to do that now. Depends on the attitudes of the people you are talking to.",
      "I agree that cars/train/boats are usually ‘she’ out of fondness. I also agree ‘lady’ and ‘girl’ can be used, but ‘woman’ is only human women.\n\nMy car is a ‘she’\n\nBut most of my dad’s cars (that he’s actually named, anyway), have been ‘he’",
      "No. It is similar to ships always called \"she.\" But totally them a woman would be incorrect. Since it is not actually a person.\n\n\nI sometimes more confusingly use male gendered language calling a random object \"this guy.\" But it call it a man or \"he\"would be inaccurate. \n\n\nA man who loves his car might call it his \"old girl\" but never a woman. ",
      "Generally, no. Sometimes people can refer to vehicles as she/her in an affectionate way and it's common for boats and ships to be considered feminine. However, in your example, it looks like the train is a character rather than an object. For that reason, it's being addressed as \"she\" rather than because trains are inherently considered women."

I suspect it got caught halfway between these two:\n\nIntel appoints engineers as part…\n\nIntel makes engineering hires as part…\n\nThose both make sense, though you don’t normally describe a private company hiring non-executives with “appoint”.\n\nBut you don’t appoint hires. “Hire” is a noun here, but it represents the action of hiring itself, not its object, ie the person being hired. So you hire a person, but you _make_ a hire. You don’t hire a hire, or appoint one. Similarly, you don’t throw a throw or cut a cut or investigate an investigation.\n\nIt must be pointed out that we do these double-specified things sometimes. It’s “take your shot” but informally “shoot your shot” is common. It’s sort of quirky and slangy, and doesn’t generalize to all words. Also, some words are ambiguous about whether they represent the act or the object of the act. You “have a meal” but “eat a meal” is fine because the meal can represent the act of eating or the food itself. Hire isn’t one of these words.\n\nFinally, it’s also true that “hire” _can_ represent the person being hired: “I have a new hire coming on board next week” is fluent corporate speech. But it’s a narrower and more contextual usage.

On the other hand I struggle to work out how long it's going to take to drive somewhere based on the distances on signs, and the temps on the weather forecast literally mean nothing to me.",
      "lol",
      "Australian here: we tend to use imperial measures in metaphorical ways.  Call it a linguistic holdover.\n\nMilestones are fine.  Also sayings like missed it by a mile, inches from disaster, thousand yard stare  etc.\n\nI'll be interested to see what non-English speaking people say.",
      "In German both Meilenstein and Kilometerstein exist, the latter referring only to litteral signs you put on a highway to mark what kilometer of that highway you are at, the former still being in use in a figurative sense of having something that shows your progress in something or something you aspire to as a step along the way to a bigger objective.\n\n\nBut as others have pointed out: the concept of a milestone is very common in European languages with them being an invention of the Romans.",
      "The woods are lovely, dark and deep,   \nBut I have promises to keep,   \nAnd kilometers to go before I sleep,",
      "Thanks to the Imperial system being the original, it's in use in old words pretty much everywhere as far as I'm aware, heck, a lot of phrases still use inches and miles thanks to the fact they're way easier to say due to the few hundred years the words had to naturally develop, for example, you wouldn't say \"walk a kilometer in his shoes\" you'd be far more inclined to use \"a mile in his shoes\".",
      "People in countries that speak Germanic languages still generally use pre-metric words with that meaning: *Meilenstein* in German, *mijlpaal* in Dutch, *milepæl* in Danish, *milstolpe* in Swedish, etc.",
      "The word milestone has existed longer than an independent USA, and longer than the Metric system. We did not get rid of every reference to miles/inches/etc when we changed measurement system, and at least in the UK most people are pretty familiar with the Imperial system and prefer it for certain applications despite using metric generally.",
      "In England, we still use the word, and we still have many examples of the physical mile stones at the side of roads. We used imperial measures for a long, long time before we went metric, and still show miles on our road signs.\n\nI suspect the use of American productivity software will keep the word alive for a long time in the global consciousness."

    "title": "What do the English words \"lowkey\"/\"highkey\" mean?  How do you use them?",
    "text": "I'm seeing the words these days.",
    "comments": [
      "“Low key” and “high key” are intensifiers used widely among Gen Z among AAVE speakers that express different levels of emphasis or certainty about feelings or opinions. \n  \nThis is the way they are used online, mainly by younger people.  \n  \nMy father, who is in his 80s, would likely intuit the following meanings but would never use these phrases in the following way. \n\n**Low key** means “kind of,” “somewhat,” or “secretly.” It’s used when you want to downplay something or admit to something you might not want to fully own up to. For example:\n\n- “I’m low key stressed about this exam” (I’m somewhat stressed, but trying not to make a big deal of it)\n- “That movie was low key boring” (It was kind of boring, but I’m not being too harsh about it)\n- “I low key miss my ex” (I secretly/somewhat miss them, but I don’t want to fully admit it)  \n    \n  \n**High key** is the opposite - it means “very,” “obviously,” or “definitely.” It’s used for emphasis when you want to be clear and direct about something. For example:\n\n- “I’m high key excited for the concert” (I’m very obviously excited)\n- “That restaurant is high key overpriced” (It’s definitely/clearly overpriced)\n- “She’s high key talented” (She’s obviously very talented)\n\nBoth terms let you express intensity while maintaining a casual, conversational tone. “Low key” adds a sense of understated honesty, while “high key” adds emphatic clarity without sounding too formal or dramatic.​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​  \n  \n- \n  \n\nThe traditional use of “low-key” (often hyphenated or written as two words) has several meanings that older generations would be more familiar with:\n\n**Subdued or understated:** “We’re having a low-key celebration for her birthday” - meaning a quiet, small, or casual gathering rather than a big party.\n\n**Secretive or discreet:** “They’re keeping their relationship low-key” - meaning they’re not making it public or drawing attention to it.\n\n**Relaxed or calm:** “I prefer low-key evenings at home” - meaning peaceful, quiet activities rather than high-energy or dramatic ones.\n\n**Not intense or demanding:** “It’s a low-key job” - meaning it’s not stressful or high-pressure.\n\n**Modest or humble:** “She has a very low-key personality” - meaning someone who doesn’t seek attention or make a big deal of themselves.\n\nIn these traditional uses, “low-key” is typically used as an adjective to describe nouns (low-key party, low-key person), whereas in Gen Z slang, it’s become more of an adverb that modifies feelings or opinions (“I low key think…”). The core idea of “not intense” or “understated” carries through both uses, but the grammatical function has shifted quite a bit.​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​",
      "VERY age specific.   I’m in my 50’s and these sound awkward used as general adjectives.   “Low key” has been around for a long time, generally used to describe things, often an event or situation, that would not require much fuss, or should not have attention drawn to it - a low key meeting, a low key party, “it was a low key affair for just a few friends and close family” “let’s keep it low key - don’t need a lot of people knowing”.    It would not have been used to describe objects or feelings… “I’m low key concerned” doesn’t make any sense to older people.  “High key” is totally new/made-up, and even more non-sensical to anyone of my generation.  I see the connection, but it sounds ridiculous.",
      "Popping in to once again point out that these are African American Vernacular English words that have become a part of the American lexicon and are not simply Gen Z slang",
      "Thanks to everyone, I really learned a lot about the words.\n• The word “lowkey” mostly means “not very important” or “not very certain” about a subject.\n\n• The word “highkey” is far less common since it’s a more recent creation, but it is sometimes used as the opposite of “lowkey,” meaning “very important” or “very certain.”\n\n• Both terms seem to come from words used in photography lighting, but there’s a possibility they originated from musical keys.\n\n･ The word “lowkey” or “low key” was often used as an adjective (e.g., a low-key meeting), so its use as an adverb might confuse some people, especially older generations.\n\n\nLove you guys from Japan 😍",
      "They're borrowed from terminology around lighting - high key lighting has limited shadows. Low key lighting has high contrast, meaning there are dark shadows. The idea of dark shadows has been extended to mean things done \"in the shadows\", or secretly - so doing something in a \"low key\" way means that it's done in a way that is secret or doesn't attract notice. This use has been semantically bleached and now it's used in a way that it's more or less just an intensifier, but a bit of an odd one in that it still carries the implication of not wanting to draw attention to it. So one might say to a friend at a party \"I lowkey want to get out of here\", meaning they would really like to leave the party, but don't want to make a big deal about it.",
      "Lowkey means \"under the radar\" or \"not seeking attention.\" I've never heard anyone say highkey.",
      "Both are slang. Lowkey means it's something you're doing quietly, sneakily, under the table, etc. \n\nHighkey is more recent and means the opposite, something you're doing very publicly",
      "i've actually never read/heard \"high-key\" used in any media.\n\nlow-key means being modest. not showy. doesn't attract attention.\n\n\"No one noticed that the groom was low-key drunk during the wedding.\"",
      ">low-key *adv. - informal* (secretly, with embarrassment) \"I lowkey want to buy a pound of candy and spend the day eating it in bed.\"\n\n\nSource: Wordreference\n\n\n>Low-key \n\n\n>informal : in a way or to a degree that is moderate or limited\n\n\n>It didn't take long for all of us to become low-key [=somewhat] obsessed with Lizzo …\n\n\n>Everywhere we go, we're low-key [=casually] checking out coffee shops, parks, and window seats for maximum reading coziness.\n\n\n\n>High-key is a slang term meaning “truly; completely; intensely,” often used to emphasize the sincerity or intensity of a statement. (Also high key, highkey.)\n\n\n>Examples of high-key\n\n\n>I highkey want a new job with more money! And I will get it.\n\n\n> … this is high key one of my favorite shows of all time …\n\n\nSource: Merriam-Webster ",
      "Low key is not new at all.",
      "\"Lowkey\" means something is kinda true but not super strong or obvious - like \"I lowkey hate Mondays\" (I don’t really hate them, but... yeah, Mondays suck).\n\n\"Highkey\" is the opposite - when you feel something STRONGLY. Like \"I highkey love pizza\" (I’m obsessed, no shame). \n\nI learned them from TikTok tbh 😅 At first I thought \"lowkey\" meant \"secretly,\" but it’s more like \"a little bit\" or \"not gonna lie.\"",
      "“Low key” was a phrase that traditionally meant something was secret, subtle, or weak. Now Gen Z uses it as an all-purpose qualifier because they don’t want to be seen to make any definitive statement. As a result you often see it on sentences that would otherwise be expressing a high degree of confidence or emotion: “I think I’m low key in love with him.” “He low key beat that guy to a pulp!” (My own generation does the same thing with “like.”) \n\nAnd therefore “high key” is used as an intensifier when the Gen Z speaker gets past their natural human reticence and wishes to actually commit to a strong statement.",

You could definitely replace it with \"through\" or \"across\", but at least in American English, most people would use \"down\".\n\nIn another context, for example, someone could say that a house that is close by is \"down the street\", which would indicate that it's a little further in the direction they indicated. Sometimes, people use the term \"up\" in the exact same manner, like \"up the street\".",

Often there's no actual vertical element involved, but sometimes there is. If you're at the top of a hill, you walk \"down the hill\". But the word has evolved to basically mean the same as \"along\" or \"across\" to describe any kind of movement.\n\nSomewhat confusingly, \"up\" can normally replace \"down\" in sentences like this, though down is more common. \"Up\" tends to imply actual upward movement. You walk up a hill, or climb up a wall, but equally you can walk up a street. Up usually implies you're walking away from something though, if not physically upwards in space.",

    "comments": [
      "\"I am not sure if it will continue\" is correct because in this case, the \"if\" is not a conditional. You're using \"if\" here for something that you're not sure about, the same way you'd use \"whether\". It's not a condition like \"if this, then that,\" so it won't follow the rules of a condition.",
      "In \"I am not sure if it will continue\", \"if\" isn't being used as something to form a conditional, it's been used as a synonym for \"whether\". \"I am not sure whether it will continue\" is a valid, non-conditional sentence.\n\nWhen \"if\" is being used to make a conditional, \"will\" is never in that clause.\n\n\"If I see you, I will leave.\"\n\n\"If her food has garlic, she'll have an allergic reaction.\"\n\n\"If you go, you'll find me there.\"\n\nSpecifically, this use of present-if and future-will is the predictive conditional, you use this when you're predicting the outcome of an event (\"if it rains, I won't drive\"), otherwise the other clause can be in present tense (\"if I leave my home, I lock the door\").",
      "\"I am not sure if it will continue.\" This is a different structure from a conditional sentence. In this case, you're using **\"if\"** not to express a condition, but to introduce indirect speech or uncertainty — \n\nI am not sure ***of what?*** \\- if it will continue.\n\nAnd in this case, using \"will\" is correct.",
      "That is generally true. \"if\" clauses usually use the present/imperfect form of the verb. But this isn't always the case, and several verb forms can be used in \"if\" clauses. Some examples: \n- if I had gone to college, I would have studied law\n- I'm not sure if I will be able to come tomorrow.\n- If I can (do something), I will.\n\n\nSometimes I've heard \"if you will\" or \"if you do\" to contrast a previous negative statement (though in this case \"if you do\" seems much more common than \"if you will\". For example: \n- You said you won't help me study. But if you *will* help me, then I'll pay you back. (Again, \"if you do\" actually sounds more natural here.\n\n\nSo, you're right that if+will is not the preferred. The main exception is with sentences like the first one you wrote, \"I am not sure if it will continue\". For this, it would sound weird to me if it were \"I am not sure if it continues\". Depends on the time reference of the referred-to event, I suppose.",
      "Hmm. \"If I will go to college, you'll be at my graduation?\" It doesn't sound \"wrong\", it just sounds excessively wordy for what it is, like the \"will\" doesn't need to be there at all. \"If I go...\" covers the future/uncertain aspect of it.\n\n\"If I'll mow the lawn, you'll pull the weeds in the garden?\" does sound like something someone would say. The whole statement would be spoken like a question, with a rising tone. It's me offering a deal to the other person + asking it as a question where we share the burden and I've already offering to do the part of the deal that I want to do.\n\n\"If you will go to school, I'll take you to the movies after\" is another example like this. This would be a parent bribing their kid to get them to go to school (which is bad parenting). I don't think this sort of construction would come up between adults at work. Your boss isn't going to need to bribe you to do something. lol \n\nA coworker might say \"If you will handle calling the client, I'll write the report\". This is nearly exactly the same as \"If you handle calling the client, I'll write the report\". To me adding the extra \"will\" adds an aspect of explicitly \"asking\" the person (you) to do the if-statement thing. The plain vanilla \"if\" statement isn't asking or telling, it's just a logical statement with no sense of action to it. Like \"if the sun rises, then XYZ happens\" (just a factual statement) into \"if you will make the sun rise, then XYZ will happen\" (I'm asking you to make the sun rise).\n\n(But also you could say \"If you could/would handle calling the client, I'll write the report\" which is asking the You to do something politely without using the \"will\". \"Will\" for permissions or requests is a bit more solid or demanding.)\n\nYou probably don't need to worry about these that much, in comparison to the main if/then tense combinations. As I'm learning another language as a hobby, I keep the thought in my own mind to focus on getting the \"vibe\" of what's going on rather than memorizing tables so that's what I've tried to convey here. If I will have explained this well, then you will have gotten the vibe.",
      "You're totally right about the general rule usually, we don’t use \"will\" in the \"if\" clause. Your example is perfect: \"If I go to the college, I will see you more often.\" ✅\n\nBut English loves breaking its own rules lol. There are cases where \"if + will\" works, like when \"will\" means willingness (e.g., \"If you’ll just listen, I’ll explain\").

Listening is in a symbiotic relationship with Speaking but for ease of communication then knowing how to speak - even in broken English  - is most valuable. It's difficult. People have different accents, cadences, conversations may have hidden meanings or be full of jargon...\n\n\nBut if you are after basics then 'a picture paints 1000 words' - draw something or point to something and you'll often be understood. ",

And weirdly, practicing with tongue twisters (like \"She sells seashells\") forced me to focus on endings.",
      "English has consonant sounds that end some words, **however** the way in which you pronounce them often depends on the next word.\n\n\nThe only time it is important to pronounce the last consonant clearly is when it's plural ('s') or with *can / can't* in an American accent.\n\n\n\nGenrally, don't think of consonants at the end of words as 'ending sounds', but rather linking sounds. For example:\n\n\n>*I want to talk*\n\n\nThat last /k/ sound is very weak. In my British accent, I basically don't pronounce it. However, look at this example:\n\n\n>*I want to talk about our future*\n\n\nNow the /k/ sound appears, and becomes stronger because it's followed by a vowel sound. 'Talk about' becomes  \"tau_kubaot\".\n\n\nIn summary, the ending consonant only becomes important if the word is plural, or for distinguishing between two similar and semantically-connected words.

You're constantly hearing  how words are parsed or blended, passively absorbing intonation and emphasis patterns across individual sentences, but also how those patterns vary over the course of a complete conversation. You're actually passively learning how prosody works and can add layers to meaning. You might not be consciously trying to hear, but each show you enjoy is adding to your awareness of how fluent speech feels and sounds and giving you a better ear for what sounds more natural. This is exactly how toddlers pick up and eventually learn to mimic their first language(s). Picking up new vocab is only one facet of developing your English. Getting a natural feel for a language is every bit as valuable and important as understanding the words",
      "Of course it helps. It’s even better with English subtitles if you know some English. It helps a lot.",
      "It helps! But to help you with actually learning, only watching movies with subs won’t do anything…\nListen to music, read the lyrics, read poems, try reading it out loud, watch those reels or tiktoks in English and not your native language, if you’re confident, change your phone language to English, talk to yourself in English if you have the chance! What helps you learn, outside of studying it, is the familiarity you get with the language!",
      "Helpful. Even more helpful if you make some notes. It also depends on your level of English - judging by your post you’re pretty fluent so it’s a great way to learn new phrases and vocab, especially idiomatic expressions",
      "Of course, exposure to the target language is essential if you want to learn it",
      "For me, English subtitles helped a LOT in the beginning because I could match what I heard with the written words. But yeah, sometimes I’d just read and not listen properly. What worked better was switching to English subtitles after watching a scene first without them, then checking what I missed.\n\nNow I try no subtitles for easier shows (like cartoons or sitcoms) and English subs for harder stuff (looking at you, Sherlock Holmes dialogues 🫠). Native language subs? Rarely, ‘cause then I just rely on them too much.",
      "I watch Spanish media with Spanish subtitles. Helps me when I do t understand something. It’s a great tool. I also watch stuff in English with English subtitles.",
      "It's hugely helpful.\n\nI've been teaching English to speakers of other languages for nearly 40 years. 20 or so years ago, young people from countries like the Netherlands, Sweden etc were streets ahead of those from other countries. We always put it down to similarity of language, the education system and the fact that native languages were not widespread. Just an interesting side note that they subtitled rather than dubbed English-language TV.\n\nAbout 5 years ago, I noticed that younger learners (teens) were beginning to arrive with really quite high-level language abilities. That's just increased. A group of 15/16 year olds from (say) South America will now have a significant number of very able English users, and the overall level is much higher. \n\nJust a coincidence that kids in countries that traditionally dubbed TV and films are now watching Netflix/Disney+ or whatever, with subtitles?\n\nMg",
      "It's very helpful to me! However, self-discipline is needed. I will really repeatedly adjust the progress bar to listen to the parts I didn't catch clearly and record the new words in the subtitles. After several times of practice, I can now watch American TV series without subtitles :D\n\nFor me, as soon as I found that I could distinguish most of the lines by repeatedly adjusting the progress bar and listening to them repeatedly, I gave up the subtitles. This is like a person in rehabilitation training just throwing away a walking stick. Yes, at the beginning, you need 1.5 hours to finish watching a 40-minute episode and frequently click \"←\" and \"→\" on your keyboard like a DJ. But soon you will get used to the speed of the lines and eventually understand the lines in one go without any stress",
      "Subtitles are like gym mirrors — helpful if you actually use them right. But if you’re just watching Netflix while half asleep, don’t expect fluent English to download into your brain automatically 😂",
      "Dude, yes! I’ve learned more English from Netflix and memes than I ever did in school. My brain’s just vibing in the background, like “Ah yes… this is how sarcasm sounds.” 😂",
      "Absolutely agree! Just watching with subs isn’t enough — it’s all about active engagement. I started talking to myself in English during daily tasks, and it surprisingly helped with fluency. Also, switching my phone and apps to English made a big difference. That passive exposure really builds up over time. Great tips!",
      ">I’ve learned more English from Netflix and memes than I ever did in school.\n\nThat's the point. School never claimed to teach you everything. They taught you basic English and you improve however you like."

    "text": "Can we blame the nature for a death that appears to be done with a sequence of inadvertent events? So, a couple of days back my driver's son died while guiding the excavator operator. As I could gather from the conversation I'd with him, his boy's feet slipped on mud or a puddle and he fell before the wheel while it was in motion. I tried to comfort my driver by saying, \"Tragedies come uninvited in our lives and from your explanation it seems nature had your son dead.\" \n\n\nSince this fatality strangely appears to be culminated through a force which we don't have a control on. Could we say that this tragedy occured from a palpable *natural* force? \n\n\nI write journals whenever I'm in the mood to put down my experience of life. And for some reason, this incident affected me and I wanted to scribble my thoughts surrounding it. However, I'm a bit unsure if we could call the invisible entity that influences our existence nature. And is what I said to my driver situationally and grammatically correct? \n\n\n\nThanks as always! ",
    "comments": [
      "Typically we would say “fate”\n\nI think that “nature had the boy dead” and “fate had the boy dead” would both sound strange and inappropriate for the circumstances, this is one of those situations where it’s probably best to just say “wow that is a really horrible accident I’m so sorry to hear it” ",
      "Just a small note about usage unrelated to your question (since this is an English learning sub).\n\nYou can’t say “from the conversation I’d with him.”  It has to be either “I had with him” or “I’d had with him”.\n\n(The reason for this is because of stress in English.)",
      "I get what you’re going for but it’s not really a common construction. It’s not something I’ve ever heard a native speaker or myself say. I might not even be totally sure of what it meant if someone said that to me. I could call something like that a “freak accident”.",
      "Your construction is understood but sounds non-standard and unnatural.  As such, it actually comes across as either old fashioned, or poetic / romantic.  It doesn't fit the tone you should use when talking to someone about the death of a family member - it sounds more like something you'd write if you were narrating the event in a dramatic poem.\n\nUnusual, non-standard language can be more powerful and evocative, because it makes us think in ways we aren't normally accustomed to.  That's why you see it a lot more in poetry, but also sometimes in dramatic prose.\n\nBut when you are comforting someone who is grieving, you're not trying to make them think in new ways - that can seem narcissistic, and just plain inappropriate.  The focus should be on the bereaved family member or friend, not on your skill with language.  Generally we would use standard, casual language in this situation.  Those left behind are dealing with emotional pain: they aren't looking to *think* about the imagery of your words.",
      "FYI, regardless of what killed the person, it is not grammatical to say \"\\_\\_ had the boy dead\" in English (at least in standard American English - maybe it would be okay in some vernaculars).\n\nIt would be grammatical, but blunt, to say \"\\_\\_ killed the boy\" or \"\\_\\_ caused the boy to die.\"",
      "I agree with the first two comments, and I would like to add that, in some places, \"to have someone dead\" means \"to make someone laugh very hard\".\n\nExample: \"My new history professor is hilarious. She had me dead for like 30 minutes straight. I was gonna try to switch the class, because it's at 8AM, but now I think I'll just make it work.\"",
      "“Nature killed the boy” however don’t say that to a family member the word “killed” is a bit crude when trying to comfort someone. Or “it was an act of nature that took the boys life” is probably more what your looking for and less crude/literal than “nature killed the boy” which sounds like literally trees intentionally strangled him.",
      "The expression used in English coroner’s courts to refer to this type of occurrence is misadventure.\n\nIt’s not really grammatically correct to use the word “nature” in this context. You might say that it was an accident, or that it was misfortune. However, when we speak about people dying, to use the word nature would suggest that the death wasn’t sudden or unexpected- ie “he died of natural causes”.",
      "A better way to say it would be \"died from natural causes.\" Or \"nature/fate wanted your son dead.\"",
      "Honestly, I think it’s the use of the word “dead” in both those phrases. While true, it comes across harsh and blunt and is not something you should say to a grieving relative.",
      "Actually the title of this post is what I titled my journal entry surrounding this sad incident. I didn't actually call his son *boy* while making him feel better. I can recall that while saying that sentence which I've mentioned in the 1st paragraph of this post. I was struggling a bit between the words *dead* and *killed*. Would using *killed* have been better suited for this sorrowful situation and also convey without completely changing the basic idea of my line?",
      "Thank you! This is precisely the intent behind posting here to filter out the grammatical errors from my journal.",
      "I agree, “a freak accident” would probably be the most common phrasing for something like this in American English. When someone dies from a circumstance that wasn’t caused by another person (either purposefully or due to neglect like ignoring safety protocols) and wasn’t intentional on their part, most people would say that it was a “freak accident” that occurred. “Freak” here means that what happened is a rare and unexpected occurrence.",
      "Okay! So, what could that unknown energy which regulates our being called apart from fate or destiny? As I've used these two words often in my writing on this unfortunate event.",
      "I completely agree with this comment; and actually I really like the phrasing. To me it sounded really poetic, like something you might read in an old novel.  \n\nAlong the lines of, “It was beauty killed the beast”, or “Now I am become death”"

    "text": "Hello,\n\nI was always very curious about pronunciation rules in English, as they seem somewhat arbitrary.\n\nGoogle says that Tiger is pronounced tie-gr, and Niger is nie-jr. Why is Tiger not pronounced tie-jr then?\n\nHope this question does not offend.\n\nThank you!",

      "Do questions like this actually help anyone learn English better than if they didn’t ask the question?",
      "Tiger has a long I and so does Niger. So it wouldn’t be pronounced the way you’re indicating anyway. This is because in syllabication, when you have a an open syllable as indicated by having a single G, the vowel is going to be long. Ti ger and Ni ger. Both have an I that says it’s name and is pronounced like in ice.\n\nIf you’re asking why the G is hard in tiger and soft in Niger, that I couldn’t tell you. English is just weird. Generally a G followed by an E can be soft, but when adding a suffix like ER or ED, it can also be hard.\n\nIt’s also worth pointing out that Niger is not English in etymology. Maybe it’s not pronounced with a long I where you’re from. I’m guessing those from France or pronouncing it with an E sound.",
      "If your question is why the country Niger doesn't rhyme with the word \"tiger\", it's because Niger is taken from French, which has different rules of pronunciation. \n\nIf you're wondering why \"tiger\" uses the long \"price\" vowel, while... let's be family-friendly and say that [Tigger](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tigger) uses the short \"kit\" vowel, the answer is that vowels are often affected by the number of consonants between them.",
      "Did you just want to post the N word? The logic doesn't track. Tiger isn't pronounced like Tigger, so why would Niger be pronounced that way? If they were supposed to sound the same Niger would be Ny-ger.\n\nBut to answer the question, Tiger comes from the Greek word tígris, pronounced similarly. \n\nNiger's etymology is a bit more complicated so I'll just copy the Wikipedia article:\n\n>The name comes from the Niger River which flows through the west of the country. The origin of the river's name is uncertain. Alexandrian geographer Ptolemy wrote descriptions of the wadi Gir (in neighbouring modern Algeria) and the Ni-Gir 'Lower Gir' to the south, possibly referring to the Niger River.[18] The modern spelling Niger was first recorded by Berber scholar Leo Africanus in 1550,[19] possibly derived from the Tuareg phrase the (e)gărăw-n-gărăwăn meaning 'river of rivers'.[20] There is broad consensus among linguists that it does not derive from the Latin niger 'black' as was first erroneously believed.[18] The standard pronunciation in English is /niːˈʒɛər/, while in some Anglophone media /ˈnaɪdʒər/ is also used. \n\nBut for simplicity's sake, the words have different root languages. So they aren't pronounced the same despite being spelled the same. This happens constantly in English.",
      "You may be confusing Tiger with the children’s book character Tigger? Tiger rhymes with Geiger and Steiger, not with ‘bigger.’ Also Niger has either a soft G (to rhyme with ‘obliger’) or zh depending on the speaker’s preference.",
      "TIE-gur \nnee-ZHER\n\nTiger is not pronounced the same way as the offensive word you mentioned.\n\nAnyway, Niger isn’t a word, it’s the name of a country.",
      "\"Tiger\" does not rhyme with the N-word in English.\n\nWinnie-the-Pooh's tiger friend, Tigger, does have a name that rhymes with that word.\n\nIn my experience:\n\n\"Niger\" the country is frequently given the French pronunciation. \n\nThe pronunciation of the river river sounds like an anglified version of that (which rhymes neither with tiger or with the N-word)--something like the name Nigel but with an R at the end.\n\n\"Nigeria\" is pronounced somewhat similarly to the river, plus -ia (though with different emphasis from the river's name).",
      "Because it’s a proper noun.\n\nIt’s the name of a country that was named after the Niger River, which was given its name in a language that isn’t English. It’s like asking why “Czechia” has a z in it. Proper nouns often break rules, especially when they’re derived from other languages.",

      "It's because of English being written down during a time called \"The Great Vowel Shift\", during this time, as the name implies, vowels changed dramatically, each (typically) moving higher in the mouth, leading to different pronunciations, (Older accents such as rural Scottish and Irish ones still often preserve some of the old vowel pronunciations). If I had to guess, The words \"led\" and \"read (past tense)\" were likely pronounced differently at the time.  \n(the great vowel shift occurred around the invention of the Gutenberg press, which is why English was being standardised at the time)\n\nWhile that accounts for most vowel inconsistencies, other oddities could possibly be related to the fact English (when written pre-Gutenberg press) was often done by scribes in monasteries who had very little contact with each other, leading to several different spellings of the same word being common.  \nThis is actually the origin of the word \"mettle\" it originally meant the same as the modern \"metal\" just being a variant spelling thanks to monastery shenanigans, but over time it changed, now meaning \"A persons ability to cope with difficulty or challenge\"\n\nwhile there are, of course, other reasons for English's goofy spelling, these two are the most prevalent ones.",

However, if you use whom people sometimes view you as pretentious (understandable, I was a nerdy little kid) and if you unironically say “swum” instead of “swam” people will look at you like you’re uneducated or have grown a second head (at least in the US) *even though **have swum** is the grammatically correct past participle*.

      "In English, word pairs with confusingly similar spellings and pronunciations like this are often the result of convergence from different origins. Two words enter the language from other cultures and gradually converge to have the same spelling, yet different pronunciations, as the semantic content is preserved and the written version is simplified. It’s more evidence of how English is several languages mashed together, with lots of invading loan words picked up along the way. There’s also the fact that old English used a whole different scheme for modifying words, such as changing the vowel sound inside the word. Over time, English adopted more instances of prefixes and suffixes instead, but some of those old word forms stuck around because they were so often used. So they’re artifacts of the way the language sounded in a bygone era.\n\nHere’s an interesting discussion of lead, lead, and led, going back to old English, and showing how lead (the metal) came to be spelled the same as lead (the action).

The reason we have the stupid spelling variations today is because someone decided to make a dictionary, which required words to be spelled one way for the rest of eternity.

So, to answer your question, when the first dictionary was written, the guy who wrote it decided read and read should be spelled the same, but lead should turn into led.

      "In a Canadian (and subsequently, American) accent, it is pronounced /rɪˈstɔr/\n\n“Rih-store”\n\nI’m pretty sure the first part is like that in British English too, with the ending being different.",
      "The stress is on the second syllable (ri-STOR).\n\n\nThis means the first syllable is unstressed. If you're not sure how to pronounce an unstressed syllable in any English word, it is *usually* a /Ə/ sound (like 'the' or 'an') or a /ɪ/ sound (like 'bit').\n\n\nFor most English speakers, 'restore' would have the /ɪ/ sound first, but it doesn't matter much because it's unstressed.",
      "You'll hear both, even within the same region.  Neither is any more correct",
      "For me, it depends on whether it's a verb or an adjective. There's a very slight difference, but it's there and I can hear it. \n\nRih-store - verb (We are going to rih-store the car.) It's more like a rih sound to me, same i as in the word fit.\n\nRuh-store - adjective (It's a ruh-stored car.) \n\nRee-store, only when you're talking about the Habitat for Humanity Re-store. \n\nOf course, now I'm overthinking it...",
      "I'd say *ree-STORE*, with the emphasis on the second syllable. Realistically the \"ree\" is pretty short, though. It's definitely not a schwa and it does have the \"ee\" sound, but not as long as is implied by most double-e's. Things get funky when you get to other forms, though:\n\nRestoration = *reh-sto-RAY-shun*\nRestorative = *rih-STOR-a-tiv*\n\nEtc.",
      "If I’m speaking carefully, or placing emphasis on the word: “ree-store”.\n\nIn casual use it often melds into another sound (“ruh” or “rih”) just because it takes less effort to say.",
      "In British English the first vowel would be either the ship vowel (risstore) or the schwa sound as in \"the\" or at the beginning of \"about\", which in US English is often indistinguishable from the uh sound you suggested. In British English uh is quite different from the schwa so if you used \"uh\" as in \"fun\" it would sound very strange. Definitely not ree-store though.",

I’m going to assume that either way you say it will be fine.

The word “ask” is famously pronounced “aks” in certain dialects, and this was more common in the past.\n\nTangentially related history: The sound “sk” at the beginning of of a syllable was turned into “sh.” Later, related words from other languages were borrowed back into English with the “sk” sound still intact. This led to some pairs of words, like “ship” and “skipper,” and “shirt” and “skirt, where the two words are related but now have different meanings. I say this is only tangentially related because if I’m not mistaken, this sound change at the beginning of a syllable isn’t really related to the relative lack of “sk” appearing at the end of a syllable.\n\nAlso wanted to add “star” is more common in computing contexts. Computer science is a relatively new science so a lot of its technical terms go against the usual scientific practice of using long words from Latin and Greek. Instead they use a lot of English vocabulary and shorten a lot of the words for things, and using “star” instead of “asterisk” is a good example of this.",

      "Wanting to be more literate is good. Not a moral failing and it's good you're pursuing it now.\n\nAnyhow, contemporary young adult books should be easy reading, if you can find something in that demographic, for middle and high schoolers/secondary schoolers then you can probably learn quite a bit from that. Once you feel comfortable with them, going onto books for older adults is a good plan.\n\nAnd don't feel ashamed if you have to look up words, that's how you learn. If you see a new word you don't know the meaning of, try context clues, and then trying to understand it with the roots/suffixes (if you see something with \"cryo-\" it probably relates to ice, for example, so \"cryostasis\" and be broken down as \"ice\" + \"stasis\"), and then finally open up a dictionary (Merriam-Webster, Oxford English, and Wiktionary are usually my go-tos) and learn it that way.\n\nA big part of vocabulary acquisition is going to be reading, find things that interest you but are still a bit challenging. If you find something too easy, try something a little harder.\n\nFor just a lot of speaking input, there's a lot of podcasts or audiobooks out there that could help you just listen to people *talking* and how they structure their sentences and use their words.",

      "TL;DR basically never from modern speakers unless they're being ironic.\n\n\nThroughout history, English (and its older forms) has had the habit of borrowing French words to sound fancy. \"Bid adieu\" or \"I bid you adieu\" is an old phrase that leans into that in a rather pompous way. You'll pretty much only encounter it in theatre, poetry, melodramatic 1950s films, and period pieces from the Victorian Era or earlier, or as self-referential humour/irony because it sounds so pompous.\n\n\"Adieu\" is French for \"farewell\" or \"goodbye\" (it actually comes from a longer phrase that means \"I commend you to God\" - here, \"commend\" takes a rare/archaic meaning similar to \"entrust\", such as in the phrase \"Father, into thy hands I commend my spirit\" from the KJV translation of the Bible, but I digress).\n\n\"Bid\" in this context is being used with the archaic meaning \"to express [a greeting, farewell, benediction, or wish]\".\n\nSo, broken down, it would be something like \"I am saying that I wish for you to have a safe journey under the protection of God.\"\n\nNow, is this the actual meaning that a modern speaker will attribute to it? No, because its constituent parts are either archaic or a shortened phrase from another language; much of the original meaning will be completely lost on modern speakers. They'll understand it as a fancy way of saying \"goodbye\" that has an overly theatrical flair because nobody has seriously talked like that for 100 years.\n\nSide note:\n\n\"Farewell\" also has archaic origins and sounds fancy/old, though not AS fancy as \"adieu\" or as pompous as \"I bid you farewell\", and could simply be used for formal effect. Really, it's the grammatical imperative \"fare well\". \"Fare\" takes the archaic meaning \"travel\" and \"well\" is the adverb counterpart of \"good\". So \"have a good trip\" or \"get home safe(ly)\" would be more idiomatic to modern speakers, depending on context.",
      "It's not common. Some people might have their own quirky sayings like this and always say \"I bid you adieu\" or \"I bid thee farewell,\" or \"hasta la vista, baby\" but it's generally done as a lighthearted thing and it's usually like that one person you know and not everyone says it. It's not something you would say in a formal setting. I wouldn't go so far to say it's done for humor, as it's not really done for a laugh, I would call it mirthful.\n\n![gif](giphy|vwvWkWVaoWFsxFXy9y)",

Like \"you don't study hard enough.\" Or \"If you want to run a successful blog, take a leaf out of his book\" carries a suggestion of you doing something wrong that he is doing right.\n\nIt's rarely used without judgement, at least in the US (or maybe, at least in my part of the US, midwest).

If I said \"I'm going to take a page out of Frank's book and do what I want and ask for forgiveness later rather than permission ahead of time\"  I'm not exactly admitting a shortcoming.

      "Through full immersion over time, yes. \n\nIf you move to a country that speaks the language and are surrounded by it and using it every day, it can happen. \n\nI have a coworker who is originally from Belgium and a native French speaker. He's been living here in the US for about 20 years now since he was 18. He speaks perfect English and has only a slight hint of an accent that you'd only notice if you were speaking to him for a while and really listening for it. But in casual conversation his accent is so faint it could almost be mistaken for remnants of a regional US accent.\n\n\nNow obviously not everyone can move to a country just to learn a language. But if you're already moving to an English speaking country, it's possible as long as you're willing to immerse yourself in the language and be patient. As in, if you go move to the UK for example and live in a community with a high proportion of people who speak your native language, that's going to hinder your progress learning English as you aren't then being forced to use English in your day to day life.",
      "The idea you’re referring to is called the [critical period hypothesis](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Critical_period_hypothesis)* in linguistics and neuroscience. Second language acquisition and bilingualism research suggests that the average is 6-8 years old, but the range for “native” acquisition of like language could be as wide as 5-13 depending on the individual.\n\nIt’s based on the idea of neuroplasticity (essentially that, and I’m simplifying a lot here, the brain prunes away a lot of your growing synapses to save energy as you grow into your environment, cutting away the unnecessary bits for your survival based around your childhood environment/exposure; you can of course grow back and form new connections when the environment changes into adulthood, but it’s *much* harder and growing something new is different than retaining something that would otherwise be lost). It’s *not* based on anything physical in your mouth, but more so your neural architecture.\n\nI’ll drag up my old cog sci lecture notes and see if I can add any interesting papers, because I remember finding this fascinating when we discussed it in my university classes!\n\nEdit to add some more links:\n\n1.) The number of neurons you have [rapidly grows from infancy until ~age 7](https://www.psywww.com/intropsych/ch02-human-nervous-system/neurons.html), where, on average, it peaks, and your brain then begins neural pruning. This continues as [your brain matures over the course of adolescence](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC3621648/) (until you hit around 24/25), but that’s highly-variable person to person and the brain is ever-changing, so don’t let this discourage you!!!\n\n2.) [this study](https://news.mit.edu/2018/cognitive-scientists-define-critical-period-learning-language-0501) sets the first drop-off to be age 10, with the second big drop-off to be 17/18. This is one of the largest datasets testing this, which is a good sign for their statistical conclusions, but they do use an explicit grammar quiz, which…I dunno how well that can measure things, I’d have to get a bit more into the weeds of the Methods section before completely supporting its conclusions.\n\n3.) Puberty is thought to play a role in the shift in language learning abilities as the brain matures.\nFrom what I remember from class, the ranges of infancy~6 (neural pruning starts), 7~12 (pruning is ongoing but the larger brain changes from puberty haven’t begun), and then 13~21 (puberty has begun and the brain is rapidly maturing, language acquisition is challenging but possible), where past that it’s *hard* to learn a second language with absolutely no first-language interference, are somewhat agreed-upon, but the exact age cutoffs are murky, a bit contentious, and highly dependent on what the researcher’s testing for/what their methods are.\n\n——\n\n*To be clear, this is the *scientific* definition of a hypothesis, meaning an idea within a field that has strong scientific backing for the moment but is subject to further change/ongoing testing as the field advances. It’s not a guess, like the colloquial meaning of “hypothesis”. Gravity was a hypothesis before it became a theory.",
      "No, it’s not true.\n\nIt is true that learning a language as an adult means you will be more likely to retain a foreign accent than if you learn as a child. It’s also the case that adult learners usually have at least a few sounds that they absolutely cannot hear the difference between, no matter what: examples are English natives who learn Finnish being unable to hear the difference between “a” and “aa”, and Japanese natives who learn English being unable to hear the difference between “r” and “l”. But adult learners can achieve native-like pronunciation without being able to hear those differences! Japanese ESL speakers can get the R and L sounds right every time without being able to distinguish “rake” from “lake” when listening. I personally am learning Mandarin in my 30s and while I absolutely cannot hear a difference between “shu” and “xu”, I can pronounce them differently because I have studied descriptions of the tongue positions and practiced until Chinese people told me it sounded right (and yes, I know both the consonants AND vowels are different, but I can’t hear the difference between French “tout” and “tu” either).\n\nAs for age 7 being the cutoff, that is just not accurate. We don’t know at what age native-level language ability becomes unlikely, because it almost certainly varies by person and circumstances, but the actual range is definitely closer to like 13-14.\n\nAnd finally, for worldwide languages like English, there are so many native accents that an adult learner who in fact has a foreign accent can be perceived as having an accent native to some other place. Plenty of American native English speakers mistake Germans with lightly German-accented English for British native speakers.",
      "It depends on what you mean by like a native. Can you achieve fluency? Yes. Will you have an accent? Yes.\n\nI see a lot of learners get caught up over the accent. But I want you to know that it’s ok. It’s very difficult to achieve a native accent in an acquired language and the vast majority of learners never will. English is so widely spoken as a second language that as a native I expect to interact with others who have different accents than my own. \n\nEven among us native speakers there are many accents, and ultimately all that matters is that people understand you. If you work hard enough you can achieve fluency and you will be understood.",
      "This varies from person to person. It's definitely harder, and harder still if you never go live in an environment where the language is spoken, but I am a native English speaker who has lived in Spanish speaking countries and I have seen non-native speakers pass for native in both directions.  I think some people have a more natural ear and can pick up and imitate sounds better than others.  I also think even the most convincing native-like accents acquired later in life probably don't survive being very tired, or very drunk, because they always take a little bit of effort.",
      "The critical period is up to about 12",
      "Is it easy? No. But I've met several people who have done it not just after seven, but as adults.",
      "Yeah, maybe hitting perfect native-level pronunciation is harder if you start later, but I’ve met people who learned English as adults and sound crazy close to native. It’s all about practice (and maybe a bit of talent lol).\n\nI started learning English at like 12, and while I still have an accent, I’ve gotten way better just by mimicking native speakers in movies and recording myself. Shadowing helps a ton! Also, some accents are just harder depending on your first language like, Spanish speakers often pick up American English pronunciation faster than Japanese speakers, and that’s totally normal.",
      "Anecdotally, I know an American who moved to Italy in his early 20s. He’s now in his sixties and is so fully immersed in the language he has actually basically lost his English. It’s wild. A New Yorker born and raised who can barely string an English sentence together. His Italian however, is perfect and native level.",
      "I think you have it backwards. If you are immersed in a language at age seven, you will *definitely* speak it natively. If you are immersed later, there is a chance you won't. However, almost everyone who moves to a new country at say, age twelve (or even later, possibly through high school), will also learn to speak the language natively. I have a met a few people who were counterexamples, i.e. moved with their family at age 10-12 and didn't learn the new language natively, but they are quite rare.\n\nThere are some people who can even learn a language to a native level as an adult, if your definition of native level is being indistinguishable from other native speakers in a normal conversation. This is rare, but it is possible.",
      "definitely. i didn't really focus on my speaking skills until i was in college. took about two years to become C1. then another year and a half at work to be C2.",
      "Yes you can. It’s not true.",
      "It depends on the person. I remember being told by a teacher that it is until 12/13 years of age, but again, we are all different regarding learning so you shouldn’t really pay too much attention to that.",
      "Maybe not 7. My sister in law had no English at all when she first came to the UK at age 8. She's now \\[foreign\\] accentless & fully bilingual \\[she works as a translator\\].  \nConversely, I grew up in one town then moved to another, with a vastly different accent, at age 30, and I will never have the new town's accent.",
      "In 6th grade (age 11) my school offered 3 languages divided throughout the year (German, French, spanish). We could then choose what we took in the subsequent years. I wound up taking 2 years of French and 2 years of Spanish. 1 teacher from each put more emphasis on pronunciation and culture.\n\nAfter school, I joined the navy and toured the Mediterranean.  Often asked by my shipmates to act as interpreter and a couple times in France, have locals ask where I was from (who were then amazed when I said US).\n\nIn my opinion, \"speaking like a native\" has much less to do with when you learned the language, and much more to do with the care taken by the one teaching you."

The time hasn't stopped being part of the past, and \"used to be\" implies that the rest of the sentence is no longer true",

Or like someone who is really old is recalling their youth. \n\n“There used to be a time I danced” I’m pretty sure is an incorrect sentence, because you wouldn’t say “there used to be a time”.

I think, outside of that weird usage, it's probably wrong. \n\n\"There used to be a time\" seems a redundant, unless you're using \"a time\" in the sense of \"a time set aside for\". \n\n\"There was a time\" is more normal sounding (I can't explain why, just how it lands on my ear) but would always suggest talking about a different epoch to me. It's still using a past tense on top of a boxing times into \"a time\" seperate from \"this time\". You're doubling the past-ness, so it feels mythical or nostalgic.",

Which would mean that \"I used to dance\" was true in the past, but it is not true now.  But that is logically impossible.  You can't (without some sort of time travel) erase that you used to dance.\n\nAnd yes, you can use \"There used to be a time\" for other purposes.\n\n\"There used to be a time when kids respected adults\"\n\n\"There used to be a time when milk only cost 50 cents per gallon\"",

    "text": "Is an em dash(—) useful as a comma in formal writing? I'm concerned that overusing it (let's say several times in a paragraph) causes complexity rather than fluency.",
    "comments": [
      "Yes, it serves several roles in formal writing. One of the better-defined uses is to offset an appositive phrase that is long or contains internal punctuation. \n\nFor example: \n\n\"The professor—whose work, however maligned, had contributed greatly to his field—was on the brink of a discovery.\"",
      "From what I’ve read, em dashes can work in formal writing, but they’re like spices best used in moderation. Overdoing it (like you said) can make sentences feel choppy or dramatic. Commas or parentheses might be smoother sometimes. Personally, I tend to save em dashes for when I really want to emphasize something or when commas would make the sentence too messy.",
      "I’m an American lawyer and I use it often (as in maybe once in ten pages) in briefs and motions to the court. I use it to connect two sentences that are closely linked.",
      "use it sparingly. it's unusual and might distract the reader if used too often.",
      "It can be useful, yes. But overuse is definitely something you will run into if you're trying to use it like that, it loses its impact if its all over the page. The best way to use it is to make something stand out, if there's a key fact that colours how the rest of the information is understood, that's an appropriate time to use an em dash.\n\nEg, criminal case says something like '...and my client admits to being at the scene of the crime — but was provably not in the room when the crime occurred'",
      "I use em-dashes to set off an appositive phrase that merits attention (setting one off with commas can feel like the AP is less important). I would only do this once every page or so for fear of overdoing it (keeping in mind that there are more visibly obvious than, say, or semicolons",
      "Yes, it is useful, but several times in a paragraph is too much. It will be rare to have a piece of writing that would call for that many em dashes and the reader will get tired of all the interruptions. Try to limit it to once  or twice a page at most. \n\n(Like one of the other responders, I am also a US lawyer who uses em dashes quite a bit.)",
      "Yes, it's very useful and extremely versatile, often breaking up a sentence more than a comma for better flow and readability. Only problem is that AI has essentially hijacked the em dash, so I restort to using double dashes so it looks less AI-like (but this isn't proper usage--just my personal workaround)",
      "I've never used an em dash in my life. Outside of a few niche professions, they're only used when an LLM is writing something. If you use an — then someone is going to think you used AI to write whatever it is you wrote (ok, that was actually the first time I've ever used an em dash).",
      "No, it is never used. It's only used by ai.",
      "I’d just add that it depends on the genre and subject too. It can really liven up narrative work like fiction and poetry, especially in dialogue, as well as some humanities fields where the work is subjective and self inserts/commentary are expected. In most STEM writing, they would be fairly out of place, especially in technical documents.\n\nPeople are bringing up AI, and while yes some people will immediately assume your writing is generated text when they see it, which is a shitty attitude, don’t use grammatically “incorrect” workarounds (like using the wrong type of dash) in *formal* writing. If you must use those strategies, save them for things like workplace emails and such where the recipient won’t take the time to actually verify that it’s authentic.",
      "Just wanted to share, I'm in a server called: [VozMate](https://discord.com/invite/BMFTEhk28w). It's not huge, but it’s super friendly and focused on helping people improve their English. They post tips every day, and you can practice speaking too.\n\nThey also recently launched a free mobile app for speaking practice, available exclusively to their Discord community. Definitely worth checking out if you're learning.",
      "And AI has pretty much ruined its usage",
      "This should not be a concern to anybody who is in a course that takes themselves seriously. Proper use of em dashes is taught in many schools and—even if associated with AI nowadays—can enhance your writing and do away with excessive comma usage. If a teacher or professor actually discounts your writing as AI solely because of that then that's a problem with the institution and is easily addressed.",
      "Fortunately, ChatGPT seems to prefer the AP style of setting off the dash with spaces on either side, whereas I learned the MLA style with no spaces. So that's my distinguishing mark for now."

      "In this context it means \"furthest from the norm\".\n\nLeft turn is sometimes used to mean going in a strange or unexpected direction. \n\nSo this person is saying it was the most different from what they usually do.",
      "In the full context it means “an unexpected direction”\n\nYou can say something like “We were talking about baking but then she took a left/left turn and started talking about her pyramid scheme”\n\nIn the paragraph, she’s basically saying that song is the most unexpected and different on that album from what she normally does. \n\nWithout the full paragraph for context, it could also be interpreted as being politically left, as in the song contains lyrics or themes of a left wing message that she doesn’t normally do. (Though with context it’s clear this isn’t what she mean)",
      "I'm only guessing the context but It means it was outside of what they would normally do, they tried something really different. Another saying meaning the same thing is it was \"left of field.\"\n\nAn alternative meaning could be that they put something really political on the album and it was more politically left-aligned than what they would normally do.",
      "This is mere speculation due to a lack of context, but \"left\" might be referring to political orientation in your case. Someone or something can lean politically left to varying degrees; hence descriptors like more, less, the least, the most, etc. can be applied.",
      "I would need some additional context. It's most likely referring to making a political statement that shows far-left political beliefs, but we also use \"left\" metaphorically in English sometimes to represent something unexpected and strange (like in the phrase \"it came out of left field\"), so if it doesn't make sense that it would be referring to a political statement, it's probably that.",
      "“Left of field”? Interesting - I always thought it was “left field” for the same meaning (that is: surprising, unexpected) and that it was a baseball reference in the vein of “touching base,” “playing hardball,” etc.\n\nMaybe I’m biased because I played left field in softball growing up, and I just want to feel special lol",

I take it we're talking about the song \"Sing\" by Ed Sheeran here, which is not a song with any particular political message, but was notably different from Ed Sheeran's established style when it was released.",
      "yes in this context it means different, unexpected. It's like saying it was the craziest thing I did on that album.. because it was really different to what I would normally do...and it shocked people.",

Not grammatically incorrect, per se, but not the way people usually say it.\n\nI would guess the original ~~poster~~ songwriter was thinking the pronunciation \"You'w're\", and since this is pretty much homophonous with the \"yo͞o-ər\" pronunciation of \"You're\" (but not the \"yo͝or\" pronunciation), that's what she wrote.",

For this lyricist, it sounded right. If you don't have an ear for it, mimicry is your best bet. \"You're\" as \"you are\" is significantly more common and accepted.\n\ne2; and, in lieu of suddenly dissecting song lyrics, I raise the possibility that it wasn't meant to be \"you were\" at all. \"You are recommended  to me by some people\" is itself a perfectly sound sentence.  \nThe niche contraction of \"you were\" isn't used and I don't have to talk about how literally anything could be a contraction anymore.",

      "we're recommended, but no longer. Are recommended and still are at present.",
      "It's somewhat disputed whether you can contract \"you were\" into \"you're.\" It looks strange in writing and only really happens in spoken English.

The use of recommended as an adjective doesn't really work though when you add \"to me by some people\" unless \"recommended to me by some people\" as a whole is doing the work of an adjective which is a little bit weird. It could also be that the singer is actually saying \"you were\" but because they're saying it fast enough it sounds like \"you're.\" A lot of online lyrics are crowdsourced and not official. I have seen lyrics for some of my favorite artists that were wrong for years online.",
      "I feel like I have to disagree with most of the comments here.\n\n\"Recommended\" can refer to a state. Someone doesn't necessarily stop being recommended just because the act of recommendation is over.\n\nIt's like \"My mother approves of my girlfriend.\" That's still true even if my mother isn't currently saying anything approving.\n\nSo, those \"some people\" might not be saying anything to Pink while the song is happening, but as long as they still think that person is someone Pink should meet, then they still recommend that person. That person \"is recommended\" by them in the present.",

    "text": "Yesterday I got a question \"describe a person who often wears unusual clothes\", and I needed to talk about it for 2 minutes. I didn't even know how to finish it in my first language, because I don't pay attention to clothes in my daily life.  \n\nI made up a classmate who liked watching anime and cosplaying. I said she was a fan of Attack on Titan (because it’s the only anime I knew the English name of), and once she made a huge Titan costume and wore it to an anime expo. She used a sewing machine to make the clothes, then painted the details on it, and finally stuffed it with cotton. It was an exquisite costume, and she’s a handy person.\n\nBut after I said all that, it still wasn’t enough, so the examiner asked me to speak more. At this second I recalled another anime, Madoka Magica. I looked up the English name after the test, but during the test I didn’t know it, so I just said, “an animation about magical girls.” I explained that in this anime, there’s a character who loses her head in a fight, so my classmate made a clay head and dressed herself in a way that looked like she was headless when she cosplayed this character.\n\nThat was my limit. I couldn’t say anything else about the topic, but it felt like only a minute had passed. I knew I was cooked, but I still had to answer the Part 3, so there was no time to be sad.\nPart 3 was also about clothes. My answers were a little bit better than in Part 2, because answering questions is easier than giving a speech. But still, my responses were too simple, just an illiterate pupil.\n\nI have got a 6.5 in IELTS Speaking when I was in high school, but this time my performance was really poor.

For example, for \"most unusually dressed\" I would have suggested santa claus or winnie the pooh. describe them as if they were real. There's no way for us (the judges) to tell if you really know someone or not, but it helps you to visualize it.",

The Titan costume and the headless cosplay are such vivid details, I think examiners appreciate when you give specific examples, even if they’re made up. And hey, sometimes the weirdest topics force us to be more imaginative, right?\n\nFor me, the hardest part is filling the time too. I’ve found that if I pause to \"think\" (aka panic silently), it helps to structure my answer like: \"First… then… also…\" just to keep rambling. 😅",

      "To be fair, a lot of native speakers who didn't know anything about anime would also call it something like an \"animation meeting.\" They would probably call it an anime convention or meet-up though since meeting is generally seen as a smaller gathering and usually more in a work context. But I wouldn't call it bad, just unfamiliar with the hobby. Native English speakers, however, are pretty awful at knowing what words and phrases to use with non-native speakers to be understood (since native English speakers get to get away with using their native tongue pretty much everywhere)."

      "\"Bibi\" is an overly-familiar nickname for Benjamin Netanyahu, Prime Minister of Israel.\n\nWhen that nickname is used by someone who is *not* family/friend it is typically meant is a minor insult to throw a bit of \"shade\" or imply that the speaker wants to be a little disrespectful. He (the PM) really dislikes it when reporters or commentators use the nickname, so doing this is a way to annoy him.

He tends to hold a lot of \"traditional\" views and often tries to start arguments with people who disagree with him in order to generate attention for his show. Sometimes this type of commentator is called \"firebrand\"; he is right-wing, but there are plenty of leftists who do use this tactic as well.\n\n\\- The Israel-Iran conflict is a weirdly divisive topic in US right-wing politics. Shapiro is of the opinion that escalating/sustaining the conflict is stupid and, possibly, politically damaging for the party. In this clip he is insulting Netanyahu for trying to escalate to full-blown war.\n\n\\- Others in the right-wing of the party believe Israel is fated to carry out a massive, apocalyptic war with Iran and/or other governments in the region (and maybe even with all of Islam).

They reject Trumpism, but they don't necessarily embrace the full left-liberal positions either. They are \"down the middle\" as we sometimes say. They engage in honest discussions and pursue what we call \"good faith\" discussions with people they disagree with in order to find routes by which society and the economy can converse and evolve. And often they even (intentionally) find topics among themselves to disagree on for the specific purpose of finding intellectual ways to think about the topic and formulate productive political debates.

The clip you shared about Israel is fairly tame but he (and others in his circles) are very aggressive in demanding people either support their very intense culture-war positions that lead to a cult-like mindset, or you have to reject them entirely at some point.\n\nIf you would prefer a mix of opinions and/or center or left-of-center opinions there are those as well (there is a long list of podcasts), but from your comments and questions in this thread I think The Bulwark would be a good match for you.",

Practice with native speakers (There might be local language groups), try to read articles and news in English and definitely try to brush up your skills and do some writing in English, getting feedback in a group like this.\n\nReal life practice also teaches you contextual wording rather than generic phrases which is so important to become fluent.

[https://dictionary.cambridge.org/us/dictionary/english/as-a-matter-of-fact](https://dictionary.cambridge.org/us/dictionary/english/as-a-matter-of-fact) The expression \"as a matter of fact\" is basically meaningless without context that makes it clear it refers to something else already said.",
      "Sounds like either there was some interaction before the video cut in or the guy was thinking something to himself that he wasn't saying out loud before he started the conversation.\n\nI've seen people kind of even use that way \" I was thinking something to myself a second ago that I'm not sharing but by the way......\"\n\nOr they just spit it out in place of \" by the way\" just because people brain fart set phrases that aren't actually the one they wanted all the time.\n\nRegardless, no, it doesn't actually make sense here.",
      "Matter of fact is usually said when someone is trying to prove a point and adding a direct counterargument to something they said. \n\n\"You're a very slow worker\"   \n\"as a matter of fact, I'm the fastest worker you have\"",
      "On its own, it sounds weird to preface the question with \"matter of fact\". I'd guess there's some missing context here.",
      "\"As a matter of fact” is used when you want to give extra information, correct someone nicely, or say something is true in a stronger way. However, it only makes sense if someone already said something first. You’re responding to an idea, not starting from nothing.\n\nHere are some good examples:\n\nPerson A: “Do you like dogs?”\nPerson B: “As a matter of fact, I have two!”\n\nPerson A: “I didn’t think you’d come.”\nPerson B: “As a matter of fact, I came early.”\n\nPerson A: “You don’t even like coffee.”\nPerson B: “As a matter of fact, I drink it every day.”\n\n\nIt’s a little like saying “Actually” or “In fact”; it connects to what was just said.\n\nIn this example sentence,\n\n“As a matter of fact, do you have a restroom?”\n\nThis sounds strange, because nobody said anything yet. There's no question or idea that you’re replying to or correcting. It would be more natural to just say:\n\n“I don't think there are any restrooms in this place?”\n\nOr if someone had just said, “Excuse me, is there a restroom nearby,” then it would make sense to reply:\n\n“As a matter of fact, there is one around the corner.”\n\nIt is also a very formal, specific way of wording, in most cases where you're self-correcting\nYou wouldn't use this phrase, and you would instead use something like: 'actually', 'wait', \"i mean\" or 'nevermind' depending on context.\n\nFor correcting others, you can say: \"actually\"; for being more polite, 'I think', 'I learned', 'I feel', 'from what i know', 'from my experience'. OR even questions like; 'could it be', or 'did you mean'.\n\nThe phrase, “as a matter of fact” needs a conversation or idea before it. It’s not made to start a brand-new topic on its own.",
      "He's not using it right.\n\n1) Properly speaking, it's \"as a matter of fact,\" but sometimes (maybe a majority of the time) people leave off the \"as a.\"\n\n2) The way people typically use it is to introduce a clarifying question or clarifying fact that reframes the conversation.\n\nEx:\n\n- \"Hey, what boat models did [company] release in 1986?\"\n\n- \"I don't know. I know [model X] was released in 1985, and [model Y] was released in 1987.\"\n\n- \"Huh. As a matter of fact, did they even release a new model in 1986?\"\n\n- \"Now that you say that, I don't think they did.\"\n\nIt sounds like the guy on TikTok just doesn't know how to use the phrase.",
      "I’d guess that part of the interaction/conversation was cut out. \n\nIt probably went something like this:\n\nHello, is there anything I can help you with?\n\n(As a) matter of fact, do you have a restroom?",
      "Shortened from 'as a matter of fact'. It's not a typical usage, but it's used here without any strong meaning as a way of starting a new topic. Kind of like 'by the way'.",
      "Yeah that’s what I thought, but it’s not the first time I hear that expression used this way, I’m starting to think that is an inside joke or a niche slang expression",
      "Actually there could be a video cut. I didn’t think of that. Also, it was an awkward situation so he might have thought something without saying it out loud at first and then started talking with that expression.",
      "It is a throwaway filler expression. Those are more acceptable in spoken language than in written language. Other examples are starting or ending sentences with unnecessary verbiage:\n\nBlah, blah, blah. You know what I am saying?\nTo be perfectly frank with you, blah, blah, blah.\nIn all honesty, blah, blah, blah.\nBlah, blah, blah, to be fair \nIn fact, blah, blah, blah.\n\nHad the conversation leading up to the question been about bathrooms in some way, perhaps the way they asked could be a segue. You use segues for minor topic changes in the middle of a paragraph or discussion. There are other uses, but most are unnecessary.\n\nBefore anyone says I misspelled Segway, please understand the use in this sentence is the two-wheeled, self-balancing scooter. The way I used it before is a term used in music, literature, or conversation, although they are homophones (words that sound the same)."

The key is consistency and not being too hard on yourself.\n\nSince you’re already at B2, you’ve got a solid foundation!

    "title": "Might've missed the basics...(Interrogative pronouns)",
    "text": "  So I came across these two different usage of Interrogative pronouns that really caught me off guard (as curiosity strucks for a beginner like me in this track).\n\n  As per arrows indicated above. Let me start with the first one: \"Who was helping who out\"—when I first read this part, it was really hard not to notice the two 'who' in the context. Again, I'm far from expert to know every nuances in the language—but I'm also no stranger towards the structure of the dialogues from the many stories I have been exposed to already. Maybe, I've grown familiarity with convo. patterns (idk, if that's a thing...) that even I might be horrible in structuring an essay is that I can still tell a little whether the grammar is headed somewhere or not.\n\n Back to the problem. I feel like the two 'who' might be wrong together or is that my intuition is telling me that the use of the latter should've been 'whom' or even a whole new phrase makeover (?) like \"who was helping one out\" (or that could've been wrong, you guys tell me😅).Either way, I'm really just relying with familiarity.\n\n  So for the second one: \"This place was supposed to be his big break\" followed by \"whose\"?—a one word reply that was enough to get me thinking really. If i were to rely again with familiarity—a simple 'who was it' or 'who\" was the only reply I was expecting to come. But the use of 'whose' perplexed me on how flexible of the usage truly is. I still don't have an idea as to why or how it was used, as well, with the \"Theodore's\" following prior? I can't also tell why there was in need of apostrophe in his name? I get that it shows 'possession' but is it a rule where the names with an apostrophe is better used?\n\nBefore it ends here, I would like to get insights whether my english is understandable or not hhehehe...",
    "comments": [
      "1. ‘Whom’ is probably correct, but ‘who’ can practically always be used instead unless you’re writing a formal paper. In conversation, many if not most people just use ‘who’ instead of ‘whom’  in most cases.\n\n2. \n- “Whose [break was it supposed to be]?” —> Who was the break supposed to be for?\n- “[Was it supposed to be] Theodore’s [break]?” —> Was the break supposed to be for Theodore?\n\nSorry if this didn’t help, I wasn’t completely sure what you were wondering.",
      "You're over-thinking things. Don't get bogged down with \"rules\".\n\n\"Who is helping who\" is fine.\n\nPedants will say that the latter should be \"whom\", but 99.9% of people don't care.\n\nIt's extremely common to say \"Who is dating who\", \"Who is meeting who\", \"Who is driving who\", etc.\n\n\"Whose\" is a very simple, normal thing to ask, when someone has said it's \"his\" and you don't know who they're referring to.\n\nYes, the apostrophe represents possession. It was Theodore's place. It belonged to him. [That doesn't necessarily mean he *owned* it - we don't know that from the context. But he 'possessed' it in some way. He lived or worked there, or something.]\n\nYes, your English is easy to understand.",
      "For the second one, \"whose\" and the apostrophe in \"Theodore's\" are both there to show possession. \"It was supposed to be his big break\" followed by \"Whose [big break]?\" The possessive whose is referring to the \"big break\" mentioned and who it belongs to. Then the reply is \"Theodore's [big break]\". Again, it's referring to the \"big break\" that belongs to Theodore. If you were to replace \"big break\" with a more tangible thing, like a book, then the exchange may make a bit more sense since the possession is clearer. \n\nAlso, your english is pretty good! I was able to understand it all easily. One thing I'll note, though: in the second to last paragraph you say \"following prior\" and those mean two different meanings. Following means after, and prior means before. So in the way you used it, you would only need to use \"following\". \n\nI hope this helps some! I did my best to explain, but if you need any clarification, feel free to ask!",
      "\"Who was helping who\" is technically incorrect but it is such common colloquial usage you could probably get away with putting it in a college paper without losing any points.\n\nFor the second one, they're asking whose \"big break\" it was supposed to be, therefore \"whose,\" to indicate possession. Saying \"who was it\" would sound really strange, and it would be very unclear what was being asked. Saying \"who\" in this case would've been less correct than \"whose\" but at least it still would've been clear what the question was. And yeah, with the exception of \"whose,\" and \"its,\" you always need an apostrophe to show possession. To answer the question of whose big break it is, you have to indicate possession, hence the apostrophe.\n\nYour English is good! There are ordinary small mistakes (e.g. \"struck\" is the past tense of strike, and will never have an \"s\" on the end - your curiosity strikes, not strucks), but very understandable, yes.",
      "Whose is the possessive form of who, like his, her, their, its. In this example they're not asking \"who is it?\", they are asking \"whose big break\" it was. It was \"his big break\" or \"Theodore's big break\" with the subject in question being the big break, not Theodore. The reason it's not spelled as \"who's\" is because that word already exists as a contraction for \"who is\".",
      "For the “this place was supposed to be his big break”. the big break belongs to the “whomever” in this case, so we say “whose” as in “whose big break” as in “who does the big break belong to” and then we say “theodor’s” as in “theodor’s big break” as in “the big break belongs to theodor” \n\nFor the “who was helping who out” I have no idea if it should be whom I’m a native English speaker and I have never used the word whom once in my life. To me it’s like the words thou and thy. Technically they exist but no one uses them or even knows how or where to use them. “Who was helping who out” is a perfectly fine sentence that sounds very natural and I’ve definatly used that exact sentence many times in day to day life. It is important to recognize that the second who is a different person from the first who though.\n\nAnd for your own English it’s very legible and understandable you are missing a few prepositions so it sounds a bit jumpy sometimes but a reread of a sentence every now and then is enough to understand the meaning. Your also missing a lot of plurals “two usages” in the first few sentences and “two “who”s” a bit later on and “strucks” isn’t a word curiosity can “strike” “you can be struck by it” or it can have “multiple strikes” the correct phrasing would be “as curiosity strikes a beginner like me in this way” or “in this field” depending on the desired meaning “in this track” works aswell although it’s a little more clunky\n\nIt should be “as per *the* arrows indicated above”\n\n“Again I’m far from an expert on every nuance in this language”\n\n“Towards the structure of dialogues I’ve been exposed to”\n\n“Maybe I’ve grown familiar with convo patterns”\n\nNot sure what the meaning is fully with the next sentence “that even I might be horrible at structuring an essay” this would mean that despite you being an excellent English speaker maybe one of the best a professional even. you still might suck at writing essays. If you want to say that because of your familiarity with convo patterns you suck at writing essays you could say “which might make me horrible (worse) at writing essays” you used the word horrible I would use “worse” personally both work.",

      "Number agreement for [collective nouns](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Collective_noun) like \"band\" varies between different dialects of English and also sometimes varies by context. Generally, in American English the word \"band\" takes singular verbs, as do the names of bands, so American speakers would usually say both \"this band is great\" and, for example, \"Metallica is a great band\". In British English it varies more – British speakers would usually say \"Metallica are a great band\" but whether they would say \"this band is great\" or \"this band are great\" can vary from person to person or from situation to situation.\n\nAn exception to that American and British distinction is when the band name is a plural noun with \"the\" in front; both American and British speakers would say, for example, \"The Strokes are a great band\", because that's a plural noun with \"the\" in front.",
      "American English: is\n\nBritish English: are\n\nAmerican English treats groups of people as grammatically singular, whereas in British English they are grammatically plural. This includes bands, institutions like governments/police, and sports teams. This content creator is Scottish, so \"are\" is correct in his dialect.",
      "In general group entities such as corporations, organisations, teams etc are seen as singular in the US but plural in the UK. I reckon this probably applies to bands as well",
      "Everyone being like \"American this\" and \"British that\" honestly either is fine. There is a cluster of words in English that are ambiguous as to whether they're singular or plural. Most any word for a group of people behaves this way - it's about whether you're talking about the group as a unit or about the group as multiple individuals - think of it in terms of pronouns:\n\n\n\"You're looking for the Marketing department? It's down this hall, on your left.\"\n\"You're looking for the Marketing department? They're down this hall, on your left.\"",
      "\"Is\" seems more natural to me, but \"are\" doesn't seem that weird.",
      "In British English, it’d be “This band is awesome!!”, but in general, ‘Band’ can use both depending on context. 2 examples are:\n\n. The band is my favourite!\n\n. The band are going on tour! (Still uses the ‘s suffix if you were to abbreviate it.)",
      "I always thought both were acceptable (UK). Sometimes there can be nuance in unifying v.s. pluralising",
      "“The band” is singular, so “Is” is correct.\n\nIt depends on context though. If you say: “the band are all going bezerk backstage!”, you’re referring to the members of the band, so plural works. If you’re treating the group as a compound unit, then use singular. If the name itself is plural, it takes the plural form.\n\nThe Dallas Cowboys ARE a good football team. So are Tottenham Hotspurs. Arsenal is, so is Dallas. The Beatles were a pop band, so are The Strokes. Steely Dan is a band, as was Led Zeppelin.",
      "British English is more likely to use plural verb agreement with collective nouns. This applies to bands, sports teams, etc. Americans will tend to use singular forms with those unless the name of the band itself is plural like “The Beatles.” Americans and Brits will both use “they” and plural verb agreement when referring to collective nouns using pronouns.",
      "This polish band is awesome or polish bands are awesome. Is for singular and are for plural",
      "I would say in my experience it depends mostly on context and where people are from. Like others have said, British English and American English differ the most here but I can remember cases where I’ve said “When are they [the band] coming on?” Followed later by, “this band is great!” So it kinda depends a little on what exactly you’re saying and in what context. Basic rule of thumb would be in American English, treat it as a singular and in British English treat it as a plural.",
      "Other people have given great explanations in the comments, but I feel like, in this case, saying \"This xxxx are\" doesn't sound quite right as 'this' is singular. Without the adjective, though, it would be 100% correct.",
      "Generally, since you’re talking about one single band, you’d most likely use a singular verb. \n\nEven though “band” refers to a group of people, when referencing only 1 single group, the subject (usually) reverts to singular, so the verb and context is (usually) singular. \n\nExamples: \n- “those birds are flying west.” (Multiple subjects, plural)\n- “that group of birds is flying west.” (One subject, singular)\n- “those two groups are flying west.” (Two subjects, plural)\n\n\nBut there are exceptions of course, as stated in the other threads. \n\nException examples: \n- “That band is great! They are my favorite. What time do they start playing?”",
      "Whilst other commenters are correct, they're leaving out a lot of context that may be helpful to know for an English learner who doesn't just subconsciously know all the nuance of American English. Yes, in British English this would sound normal and in American English it would sound odd and unnatural, but not because you can't say \"This band are...\" In fact, there are situations where saying exactly that would add meaning to the sentence. This is because American English speakers love to treat singular, collective nouns as plurals when they're referring to the collective as a group of individuals. Thus, \"This band *is* awesome!\" but \"That band *are* the biggest assholes on the planet.\" Note how the conjugation change actually imparts meaning to the sentence—by pluralizing the verb the band becomes individuals rather than a vague entity that includes works, people, and performances. This isn't something you have to learn, but it is a subconscious practice I've noticed in myself and other native speakers.",

It’s not really appropriate in any context, it sounds archaic and artificial in pretty much any modern context I can think of.\n\nThat said, speak however you damn well please, twist the language as you wish, screw the rules. \n\nBut you deserve to know (if you care) that a lot of people might think you sound a little funny if you do that.",
      "I’d say Goodbye but I’d add something onto it like “I really enjoyed our english classes”to express your gratitude (It feels more natural to say this in my opinion). Farewell isn’t really a term used (or at least i use) anymore. There isn’t a difference between farewell and goodbye. Farewell just comes from middle english meaning “travel safe”. It’s used to be poetic or formal. Goodbye is just more used in modern contexts.",
      "Almost nobody uses farewell in everyday speech anymore unless they’re being funny. ",
      "I don't think I have ever seriously said \"farewell\" to someone in my life. It's quite dramatic and old-fashioned. Just say goodbye and thank your teacher for their work with you (assuming you appreciated the classes!)",
      "I’ve honestly never used the word farewell; it’s very archaic. There’s never going to be a time when it’s appropriate to use it because it’s not in use.",
      "Dramatic like i would wonder if i would ever see that student again. Its an old word and sounds like it. I’ve only ever heard it in meoldramatic movies or when people are being funny.",
      "Farewell is very formal. It's excessively formal in the vast majority of cases and is hardly ever used unless someone is intentionally trying to sound dramatic.\n\nGoodbye is the standard.",
      "It's a formal, literary word. You should use something more common, such as \"goodbye.\"",
      "Better than either one would be to express your thanks and appreciation.",
      "Farewell has fallen out of common usage because it arose mainly because people would have to walk or ride a horse for miles to get to where they were going which could take days or weeks. It basically means the same as \"safe travels.\" To fare in this sense means \"to journey.\" Because of this it might seem odd to a native speaker. It might be appropriate still if the person is going on a long journey that will take days or weeks (which can still happen it's just rare). Goodbye had a similar origin but it has become accepted for general usage. Goodbye started off as \"god be with ye\" also wishing someone a safe journey.",
      "When in doubt use goodbye.\n\nBut casually speaking, English is pretty loose with terms like these(greetings, farewells, yes and no, etc) so you'll often see people borrow terms from other languages or just make up new ones. So you can pretty much use whatever word you like for it --especially amongst friends.\n\nI personally use farewell quite often but I like to be dramatic and that may not be appropriate depending on the sort of relationship you had with them. If you joked around often then go for it if you want to otherwise it may be best just to stick with a goodbye and thank you.",
      "English doesn't have a distinction between \"goodbye for now\" and \"goodbye forever\" unlike French and a few other languages, if that's what you're asking. \n\nFarewell just sounds a little odd to be honest, it's more of a literary word, you read it in books but hearing it is rare",
      "\"Farewell, dear teacher. Thank you for imparting on me the basics of the college courses which will be used in my career.\" \n\nOn a more helpful note, farewell would be acceptable with a teacher you're close to (or the theatre teacher), but for a regular goodbye, it's is over the top.",
      "I don't think I've ever actually heard someone use the word farewell. People don't really say that, at least not in America. Technically it would be the correct time to say it, so you could if you wanted to."

      "It simply continues the previous sentence at the same place, to avoid repetition.  \"If I hadn't gone through the experience of being told... If I hadn't gone through the experience of listening to other people's opinions...\"",
      "So when parsing a sentence like this, em dashes contain an optional clause, you can leave it out and still have a good sentence. So the optional clause is supposed to provide context or clarification. In this case, you can see the main sentence also has a clause starting with “of”, it’s a safe bet that the two clauses are meant to be from two versions of the sentence which work together to get a meaning across. So you could read the sentence twice, alternating which clause you keep in the sentence. \n\nWithout the “of” it would be harder to draw the connection to the “of” phrase in the main sentence, but it’s possible since the first word in the clause is a present participle it’d draw attention to the present participle in the main sentence and achieve the same effect. ",

      "\"I be feeling good today\" would be incorrect in both standard business English and AAVE.\n\nIn AAVE, \"be\" serves to mark a habitual action. \"He be eating chicken sandwiches for lunch\" does not mean that he is having a chicken sandwich for lunch today, it means that having a chicken sandwich for lunch is his usual habit. That not having a chicken sandwich for lunch would be a routine change of magnitude that it would be remarked upon for being unusual.\n\nBut keep in mind, ChatGPT doesn't actually understand what it is putting out. It doesn't really know what words mean beyond how those words were used in the dataset it was trained on. And the datasets are not curated for correct word usages, or proper grammar. Every angsty early 2000s LiveJournal text-wall of Lord of the Rings meets Inuyasha slash fanfiction is given just as much weight as the word's use in the Oxford Dictionary.

As far as I can tell, it can indicate a habit, but it doesn't have to. In my experience, a common phrase is, \"He be playin',\" which can either mean, \"He is acting unseriously,\" or, \"He often acts unseriously,\" though I think they will also say, \"He always be playin',\" to indicate that it's a habit.",

But google does say that it is use in AAVE as a marker of habitual or ongoing action.\n\nTaken from Wikipedia : In AAVE, use of *be* indicates that a subject repeatedly does an action or embodies a trait, so it does make sense in AAVE as \"feeling good\" could be a embodiment of being Happy. \n\nbut to be honest, as a im a American English leaner, can't give you a good answer because i didnt even know what was AAVE until i read your post.",

      "the metaphor of calling past problems (in this case scandals, controversies, etc) 'baggage' was extended in a humorous way, making the reader picture it filling not just one bus but a whole bus depot full of busses  \non the other hand the writer felt that her speech and the manner in which she gave it sounded fitting for (the positive traits one would hope for in) a president",
      "Something like “Hillary Clinton has a history of doing very shady/immoral/problematic things, but in this situation, she spoke like a president should”",
      "Baggage- things that “weigh you down”",
      "After reading the comments, it seems as if English grammar and vocab have more exceptions than the actual rules!",
      "\"Baggage\" in an idiomatic sense typically means something like \"issues\" or \"problems,\" so what is being said is that she has a lot of issues that would impact the country/her ability to lead, but she sounds presidential while speaking.\n\nPeople are said to \"carry their problems around with them\" or \"offload their problems on other people,\" so naturally using \"baggage\" to symbolize this makes sense.\n\nSince bus depots are places people may take literal baggage (luggage), having enough to fill one means having a lot.",
      "Thank you guys a lot for answers !",
      "Often people talk about having baggage when that have something from their past they they carry with them into the new relationship. There is a negative connotation. So it's rude to call a single parent's child \"baggage.\" If they have issues or problems due to past trauma then it can be referred to as baggage.\n\nIn general, you would not tell someone that they have baggage (it sounds rude) but someone might joke about their own baggage in a light hearted way and that is socially acceptable.",
      "Think about it.\n\nIt means she has a lot of baggage, right?\n\nThat's all.\n\nI'm sure you know that \"baggage\" can mean literal bags, or it can figurately mean concerns. Problems.

So with Clinton specifically that would be things like Benghazi, her-emails, whatever.\n\n\nThe sentence: She has a lot of controversial history, but in this video she speaks and acts in an appropriately serious/presidential way.\n\n\nBy the way: it's \"Looking for help with...\", there's no such thing as \"a help\"",
      "\"Baggage\" in this sense means \"emotional problems/past issues\" and they're also using it to mean \"luggage\" as part of the metaphor. So they're saying that she has enough pieces of luggage (each full of emotional problems) to fill several busses, but that she finally had herself together emotionally and was acting how the commenter thinks a president should act.",
      "“Emotional baggage” can also mean trauma, regret and similar emotions over something that happened in the past, but I believe in this case it’s referring to things that SHOULD cause her to feel regret, so the things she’s done that the poster views negatively",

(Why do events happen AT seven o'clock but ON Saturday?)\n\nAs for your examples:\n\n* \"There is a lot of truth to it.\" --  I might use this phrase to describe a story that is based on facts but has a few fictional/mistaken elements as well.\n* \"There is a lot of truth in it.\" -- I might use this phrase to describe a book that raises several valid points. \n* \"That snack has some tacky taste to it.\" -- I wouldn't use this exact phrase (or describe food as tasting \"tacky\") but it does sound like something a native speaker might say.\n* \"That snack has some tacky taste in it.\"  -- This phrase sounds odd to me.",
      "The function of to in these sentences is to identify two things that are associated with on another. \n\nThe answer to your second point is no.",
      "gonna echo the other comments that this construction feels finnicky, and i don't know any hard and fast rules\n\nthis is unrelated but in your second example sentence i wouldn't say \"some tacky taste\" but \"a tacky taste\"",
      "I've never really thought about it. The best I can come up with is that you're taking a quality and applying it to something. I wouldn't say it's possessive.\n\n\"There's meaning to life.\" (Life is meaningful)\n\"There's truth to the claim.\" (The claim is truthful)\n\"There's more to the game than winning.\" (The game has more purpose than simply winning)\n\nWhat I would say is that often times it's used to apply a quality to a partial degree.\n\n\"There's some truth to the claim.\" (The claim is neither entirely false or entirely true)\n\n\nTo your second point, you could replace \"to\" with \"in\" in some circumstances, but it changes the meaning of the sentence.\n\nIf you said, \"There's meaning in life,\" what you're subtly implying is that there is something contained within life (such as a hobby or a marriage) that is meaningful, but that life itself isn't meaningful. It's kinda like the difference between having a blue can vs a regular can with something blue in it.",
      "I think it's number 4 here (\"used as a function word to indicate...possession\"). \nhttps://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/to\n\nI think this is also what's used in \"there's nothing to it\", which can mean a task has no difficulty or that a belief has no validity.",
      "Probably a relic of Old English.",
      "Not so much possessive as locational, so yes it can be replaced with in.\n\nThe implication with to is that the truth or taste has come later (been put into it) while in assumes it's always been there to an extent.",
      "Agreed. I can't find an established term for this use. Cambridge Dictionary includes examples like these under the \"belonging\" use, meaning \"having as a characteristic feature\":\n\n- \"She has a mean side to her.\"\n- \"There is a very moral tone to this book.\"\n\n...Which I feel might be a more metaphorical extension of the other \"belonging\" usage (\"matching or belonging\"):\n\n- \"My dad gave me the keys to his car.\"\n- \"I've lost the pants to this jacket.\"\n\nI'd even say Cambridge's \"connection\" usage feels related as well:\n\n- \"There's a funny side to everything.\"\n\nI also found this thread discussing it:\n\nhttps://english.stackexchange.com/questions/393476/meaning-of-has-a-to-it\n\nPersonally I'd say this use of \"to\" frames the association between the object and the noted characteristic as slightly more loose, vague, or indirect than just saying \"X has Y\". It's like you want to emphasize that X has the quality Y without implying any particular amount or intensity of quality Y.\n\nFor instance, in your example with the cookies, \"these cookies are bitter\" or \"these cookies have some bitterness\" sounds a little more... assertive, I guess, than \"there's a bitterness to these cookies\". The latter feels like it could even just be a hint of bitterness, so I'm more so emphasizing my discernment of that quality, no matter how small. It's like I just want to loosely associate the label \"bitterness\" with the cookies, and by being more verbose (and thereby watering down) the relationship between X and Y, I am by contrast drawing more attention to my *perception* of that label. It's a very subtle difference though.\n\n(This may be just me personally, but this use of \"to\" reminds me a bit of the purposely vague and non-committal \"je ne sais quoi\", but without the positive connotation and with more specificity of what the quality is.)\n\nIt really seems like there should be a term for this specific use of \"to\" though. I would call it something like \"characteristic 'to'\" or \"associative 'to'\".",
      "Thank you! This is super helpful!! Great answer\n1. Why do you think it's a hard one in particular?\n2. It seems like the most common usage is with the structure of \"there is X to...\", right? \n3. Are there common structure beyond that one?\n4. In your last example, will it be OK to omit the last two words: “Wow, this sauce has some kick!”",
      "Thank you very much. What if we replace \"tacky\" with \"tangy\"?",
      "Thank you!",
      "Thank you. First time I see the word \"finicky\" btw!",

    "title": "Is there any rule for choosing between \"to verb\" and \"verb+ing\"?",
    "text": "Have you ever been wrong in choosing between them? Have you ever been unsure about which one to use? For example, when I know the meaning of the word \"struggle,\" but I haven't looked it up in a dictionary, how do I know whether to say \"struggle in/with/whatever **doing something**\" or \"struggle **to do something**\"? (I mean the word after \"struggle\", most of comments are talking about the tense for it)\n\nHow do you native English speakers handle that? Or just remember it from daily conversations/readings?",
    "comments": [
      "I think most commenters are misunderstanding your question. You seem to be asking about the verb form that *follows* the verb \"struggle\", not the form of the verb itself. \n\nAnyway, this area of grammar is called \"verb patterns\" and it's something you mostly just have to learn.",
      "English native speakers would not have trouble deciding which verb form to use because we have grown up with the language. We know which one to use from years of exposure to it beginning from birth. We have decades of experience with English so it’s second nature to us. Most native speakers don’t even consciously think about the verb forms whatsoever. It is entirely second nature to us. \n\nThere are rules to a degree:\n\n1. Gerunds come after prepositions: We left the zoo after seeing the giraffes. \n\n2. When functioning as the subject of a sentence, we use a gerund: Running is my favorite activity. Technically you can use an infinitive, but this is not as idiomatic and is stylistic. It’s also not possible in every situation. \n\nEtc. \n\nBut knowing which form to use after certain phrases or verbs requires memorization because there is no reliable pattern to follow except for with auxiliary verbs or in certain voices (passive, causative, etc.). \n\nSo we use a gerund after verbs like: avoid, enjoy, suggest, mind, recommend, keep, etc.\n\nWe use infinitives after verbs like: agree, learn, plan, hope, promise, want, etc.\n\nSome verbs can use both without changing the meaning much: like, love, hate, begin etc. \n\nSome verbs can use both but the meaning does change. A classic example is “stop”: I stopped eating -> I was eating but I ceased this activity / I stopped to eat -> I was doing something else but ceased this activity so that I could start eating\n\nThis is also true of set phrases where some take gerunds and others take infinitives, and you unfortunately have to just memorize this.",
      "For \"struggle,\" I’ve mostly heard \"struggle to do something\" (like \"I struggle to wake up early\"), but sometimes \"struggle with doing something\" works too? It’s kinda messy. What helped me was noticing patterns like verbs after \"enjoy\" always take -ing, but \"want\" always takes \"to.\" No idea why, just brute-force memorization lol.\n\nNative speakers probably just go by ear, but for us learners, I’ve found reading a ton (like Reddit threads or short stories) helps it stick naturally.",
      "I see a couple of issues you could be asking about.\n\n[What preposition goes with what verb? Here's a list](https://www.thefreedictionary.com/Prepositions-with-Verbs.htm)\n\n[Whether the following verb takes the to-infinitive form or the -ing form](https://dictionary.cambridge.org/grammar/british-grammar/verb-patterns-verb-infinitive-or-verb-ing)\n\nIf you're talking about the difference between \"I struggle to go to bed on time\" and \"I am struggling to go to bed on time\" that's a verb tense thing. These both mean basically the same thing. \"I struggle to...\" is more of a general thing, there's a little space between that issue and you talking here now. The -ing ending to us specifically invokes the 'vibe' that it's something that's specifically ongoing or something you're dealing with or in the middle of currently.\n\nSo it's like \"I struggle to go to bed on time\" would make sense to say during the day or when you're not in a situation where you could be going to bed, you're talking about that in general as a pattern, whereas \"I am struggling to go to bed\" would be us chatting online late at night when you could stand up and walk to your bed and get in it at this very moment, but you aren't, you're still online doing computer things.\n\nHere's another example:\n\n* \"I have to study for school\" = it's a pattern or thing in general you have to do\n* \"I am having to study for school\" = I am currently in some sort of study plan for school, like I studied last night and I'm going to study again tonight, or I am currently at my desk studying this very moment, or something in the situation is obligating me to study",
      "“Struggle in doing something” is wrong. Your choices are “struggle with doing something” and “struggle to do something.” Both are correct.\n\n“Struggle” may not be the best example, though, because it implies a second party (the thing you struggle doing), therefore there’s preposition that goes with the gerund and it’s “with.” In most other cases, you wouldn’t use a preposition with the gerund.\n\nTo use other examples, there’s no difference between “I like to cook” and “I like cooking.” Or “I tried to talk to her” and “I tried talking to her.” (Notice I used past tense; “I try to talk to her every day” and “I try talking to her every day” are also interchangeable for the most part).",
      "If you’re talking about preposition usage, that’s just something you pick up.  To struggle WITH is the most common choice, as it’s a verb that basically means “to fight”, with a connotation that you’re not doing well at winning—like you’re kind of flailing around—so “I struggle with depression” or “He’s struggling with mathematics” work, but other prepositions can introduce other clauses about the struggle, such as “he’s struggling (in school)” or “she struggled (through the divorce).”  And yes, you could say struggle + infinitive, such as “I struggle to understand her,” but if you were to take the similar verb “to grapple,” you wouldn’t say “I grapple to understand her.”  It’s just something you learn.\n\nIf you’re comfortable reading English, there’s a great book by Steven Pinker (a linguist) called The Stuff of Thought that is overall about learning how we think by looking at how we use language, but is also really enlightening about how we unconsciously sort verbs into very specific categories that allow us to use each category in some ways but not others—for instance, you can “stuff the turkey with breadcrumbs” OR “stuff breadcrumbs into the turkey,” but you can only “fill the glass with water,” NOT “fill water into the glass,” even though both verbs are about putting something into something else, and there’s an actual pattern to which verbs about putting A into B follow one rule and which follow the other.  It clarifies that what sounds arbitrary about English often is not, and that all languages have these ways of grouping things.  I highly recommend it.",
      "Partly we just remember, and partly it becomes intuitive. It's \"to\", btw.",
      "Normally you would say \"struggle with\" when you’re talking about something you have trouble with in general. Example...I struggle with being on time,  I struggle with sleep, I struggle with doing my homework.\n\nIf you want to use \"to,\" then it’s \"struggle to\" + the base form of the verb (infinitive).  \nEg...I am struggling to do this work. I am struggling to finish my lunch. I am struggling to stay awake.\n\nIf you want to use \"in,\" it’s usually followed by a particular subject, activity, or situation, and adds more context.  \nEg... (I love school but...) I struggle in science class. (I'm great at team sports but...) I struggle in athletics. ( I need to drink more water because...) I really struggle in this heat.\n\nWe don't really say struggle in doing (something)\n\nYou are more likely to say \"struggle with doing something\" or \"struggle to do something,\" depending on the sentence.",
      "First of all I think using \"at\" sounds more natural then \"in\".\n\nIf I said \"she will struggle to lift that box\" or \"she will struggle at lifting that box\" those are both grammatically correct and they both roughly convey the same idea.\n\nIf you said either I don't think anyone would really find it odd or comment on it and they would certainly understand you.\n\nI mulled over different verbs in my mind and I think that it generally works interchangeably. You can struggle at swimming across a river. Struggle at hitting a major league fastball. Struggle at cooking a meal.\n\nYou can also struggle to swim across a river. Struggle to hit a major league fastball. Struggle to cook a meal.\n\nI guess using \"verb+to\" seems a bit more like you're talking about this one specific time it's happening. And \"at verb+ing\" seems a bit more like you're talking about the person's abilities in general. But you can absolutely use both for both cases.",
      "In your first example, the \"in\" is superfluous. \"I struggle doing something\" is as valid as \"I struggle to do something\". Of course, \"struggle\" is also a noun, so you could equally say \"I find it a struggle to do something\".",
      "I will start by saying that there are many situations where one is correct and the other isn't. You can say 'I want to eat,' but not 'I want eating.' For these ones, you really just need to memorize the verb patterns.\n\nThat said, in the context you gave (where either is possible) there is little difference between one over the other. Generally, 'to verb' is more formal than 'verbing,' but neither is considered strikingly formal or informal.\n'I prefer to fly' is more proper than 'I prefer flying,' though both are acceptable.\n\nHowever, when the verb acts as the subject of a phrase, 'to verb' is significantly more formal. 'To read is good for the mind' is much more literary than 'reading is good for the mind.' In this situation, the latter is much more common in casual spoken English.\n\nIn all of this, I speak with personal experience with American English. Some things might not apply to other dialects, especially regarding formality.",
      "It sounds like you're asking which preposition/verb phrase to use between struggle and the next verb. Is that right? \n\n\nI think these\n\n\n- struggle to [verb]\n- struggle in/at/with [verb]ing\n\n\nAre mostly the same, but from my gut:\n\n\n\"struggle to [verb]\" means the task itself is difficult to accomplish, or even start. \n\n\n\"struggle in/at/with [verbing]\" is giving the *context in which someone struggles*. It's usually at the task in the gerund, but could be something else happening at the same time. It also places the struggling mid-action, so they can clearly do it at *some* level, just not well.\n\n\nThat's just my gut reaction.",
      "This is not something that native speakers ever think about. We just learn it unconsciously. But it seems to me that the second construction is much more typical.",
      "Reading the responses, no-one has mentioned a thing I've realised myself.\n\nA lot of times we write the gerund/-ing form, when we would say somethING.\n\nTry somethING\n\nTry runnING\n\nAvoid somethING\n\nAvoid beING late.\n\nYou can't struggle something. But you can struggle WITH something.\n\nTherefore I can say \"I struggle with doing something\". I struggle with socialising. I struggle with doing math.\n\nWhen using the infinitive, you need the full infinitive. I struggle to socialise. I struggle to do math.\n\nYou need to learn which verbs can be verb + something, and that \"something\" can also be an action, not just an item.\n\nYou do \"send\" something, but you can't send an action. So you send an email, but \"send emailing\" doesn't make sense.",
      "There is a very very subtle difference between \"I struggle to do this\" and \"I struggle doing this\". A lot of the time they are the same thing\n\n\\- \"I struggle to do this\" might mean \"I find it hard to do this thing *at all*\", maybe I won't even try to do it, maybe I won't begin to do it.\n\n\\- \"I struggle doing this\" might mean that you try very often, begin to do it very often, but while you are doing it, you find it very hard.\n\n  \nHere's an example:\n\n\"I struggle to get out of bed\" - to me this is what I would say if I am too tired or lazy or depressed to get out of bed. To me it means it is too difficult to even try / start to get out of bed.\n\n\"I struggle getting out of bed\" - to me this means - When I try to get out of bed, I face difficulties while I am doing it - maybe because of pain or mobility issues. I have the motivation to do it but I struggle actually doing it."

At best it could mean the person might now be easily offended about the particular issue they have a chip on their shoulder about, but not necessarily just generally easily offended about anything.",

I would say \"will you\" or \"would you\".\n\nEDIT: Apparently there are sources, such as Cambridge Dictionary, which list \"can you\" (as well as \"won't you\") as a valid tag for imperatives: \n\nhttps://dictionary.cambridge.org/us/grammar/british-grammar/tags\n\nHowever, I stand by my original answer that this sounds odd to me and the only two options for imperatives that sound natural to my ears are \"would you\" and \"will you\". Even the negative versions \"wouldn't\" and to a lesser extent \"won't\" sound a little off to me with the imperative. IMO it doesn't really matter if a version with the tag words at the start of the sentence would be grammatically correct (which would leave multiple valid options in the OP anyway); when it comes to question tags for imperatives, only two sound natural to me.\n\nThis might be regional or maybe tags for imperatives are just falling out of use in general, since when I think about it, I'm not sure I've ever personally used them with the imperative, even with \"please\" added (as all the options in the OP sound pretty rude regardless of grammar, as others have said). It just sounds a little old-fashioned or clunky to me.",

      "It's D but the natural way to say is can you get me something or will or would or could you get me something\n\nYou could say shouldn't you get me a drink in certain situations though it may sound rude. You could also say won't you get me a drink and it means almost the same as will you but more passive aggressive. You could even say are you going to or aren't you going to. \n\nThey all ask a similar question will you do a thing or are you not going to do a thing? Since there are only two outcomes you can phrase it as a negative or positive and they mean the same thing.\n\nTechnically, \"can you\" means 'is it possible' but it is extremely common for \"can you\" to mean \"will you\". This is polite language where you are giving the person a choice to say yes or no; so \"can you\" is more like \"is this an option for you\" and \"will you\" is like \"are you going to\". Kind of like how you ask someone who is clearly wearing a watch: \"*do you know* what time it is?\" instead of \"what time is it?\".",

None of the other options result in grammatically and/or logically sound sentences if rearranged (except maybe \"shouldn't\" in some very specific situations that we can probably ignore). But as others have said, while D is technically fine, it's awkward. \"Would you\" or \"will you\" are both more natural ways to say this--though, again, this form would come across as somewhat impolite unless you were good friends with the person you're asking.",

It comes from “take care of yourself” which implies that you will be away without me for a while that I won’t be there if you need me to take care of you. \n\n2) It’s a very cold and distant way to say goodbye.

Before that, it was more common to use two fingers. But always facing outwards.

      "A pumpkin plant isn't ordinarily given a gender and would usually be called \"it\". In this case, the person in question is personifying the plant by calling it \"she\", perhaps as a way of expressing affection for the plant.\n\nThe gender (he/she) was chosen by the person.",
      "They do the same with ships, cars, and even compost piles (I know this thanks to r/composting). As I understand it, it's the way to show affection towards an object.",
      "It is in fact entirely arbitrary. Some things are traditionally one or the other, like ships being female, but you are free to decide what gender your pumpkin plant is.",
      "This is just meme-speak. A plant is an “it,” but sometimes, when we are proud of something, we pretend it’s a person and give it gendered pronouns.\n\nMy basil plant is a “she” (Gertrude). \n\nMy eggplant plant is a “he” (Derrick).\n\nBut they could have been swapped.\n\n——\n\nBy convention, boats and countries are often “shes,” but this is poetic and increasingly uncommon.",
      ">I know only a few examples like a whale can be \"she\"\n\nWhat do you mean by this? Any animal can be a \"she\", provided its biological sex is female. I don't know of anything unique to whales.",
      "My monstera plant is named Rajeev (male) and my soon-to-be-identified cactus is named Anjali (female). it’s just a way to show affection. inanimate objects don’t actually have gender, we just treat them like they do if we really like them :D",
      "Many plants reproduce sexually, so there are logically male and female plants. That’s how pollination works: flowers are all about sexual reproduction!(Some plants are male, some are female, some are both). Fruits (like pumpkins) are the ripened ovaries of plants, so you *could* call this plant “she,” but actually pumpkin plants have both male and female flowers on the same plant (they depend on pollinators like bees to transfer the male gametes from male flowers to the female flowers) so they are..bigender? Bothgender? More accurate to call the plant they, probably? \n\nIt’s not common, though, even with gendered plants. Most people would say “it.”\n\nAlso, some people just gender things. Many people call their guitars, boats, or cars “she” and even give them female names. I think it’s weird, but it is pretty common. That might be what’s happening here.",
      "Usually, it'd be \"it\".\n\nBut you can give anything a gender (or name) if you feel like it.\n\nIf I had a cactus, I could call it Tom and then it'd probably be a he.  \nIf I called it Sally, it'd probably be a she.\n\nOverall, it doesn't mean much and is just some silly fun.\n\nAlso, generally, you'd only give names and genders to your own things or things that no one owns.",
      "It should be \"it\" but \"she\" is more endearing. It's apparently a very important plant to its owner. \nBack in the days of Old English, this language also had gender, but I don't think this is the remnant of that. \nIt's somewhat common to choose \"she\" where there's no reason to choose any specific gender. For example, some books will refer to the reader as \"she\" - most likely a deliberate choice, because there's no real reason for it to be \"he\", \"it\" doesn't fit, but singular \"they\" would be best.",
      "Plants don’t really have genders, but sometimes people who care for them, either farmers or people who just enjoy planting, can name plants and give them pronouns. Much along the lines of people calling cars/boats girls or boys like: “She’s a beaut, took me across the lakes.” Referring to inanimate objects (or in this context a plant) with affection or just giving it a gender/pronouns for identification purposes.",
      "boats have gender, but other objects don't. in this case, the plant is being assigned a gender to personify it and show affection.",
      "As others have said, plants don't usually have gender in English, and in this instance it is most likely a combination of affection and personification, and she would be used instead of he because she's going to make babies.",
      "if its something youre fond or proud of you might say she. if its just some random thing you might say he, like another car in front of you or a stupid-looking animal",
      "While people are right, I think it misses some small points. Using phrasing like this is one thing that really distinguishes native speakers from just fluent speakers. It is a way of speaking that gives \"flavor\" to the phrase. In the past, \"he\" could be used here, and it just means generic \"they\" and not gendered. Using \"he\" has fallen out of style for being needlessly gendered and potentially sexist. People call things \"she\" to communicate a type of affection. It is like, \"My friendly, nice plant  is doing well and growing well.\" Like think of some endearing phrase you would give your car to imply it is your old, beloved, and trusted vehicle that you have gone through a lot together with. It is more than just personification. It creates an image of affection, like they are a dear and close friend as well."

But \"reach to\" sounds kinda off, like the hand is stretching toward it but not necessarily trying to take it. I remember mixing up similar prepositions before (still do sometimes lol). Like, I used to say \"I’m waiting you\" instead of \"waiting for you\" prepositions are tricky!",
      "**Which** is more correct?\n\nThe first one is correct.\n\nYou reach **for** something that you are picking up.",
      "\"A hand reaches to the remote\" has stripped agency from the hand. The hand is closing in on the remote, but we are unable to guess as to why. Which is a fairly cool effect, and plays well with the fact that the hand has already been severed from the person I assume it would be connected to. It's not \"his hand\" or \"her hand\" it's \"A hand\".",
      "Nobody else has said this, but you would rarely if ever say \"a hand reaches for the remote\". You would say the person it relates to reaches for the remote. Saying a \"hand\" reaches for the remote makes it sound like the hand is not attached to anything and is in its own.",
      "for",
      "Those are two separate actions.\n\nA hand reaches **for** the remote means that the purpose of them reaching is to get the remote.\n\nA hand reaches **to** the remote means that the purpose of them reaching is to touch the remote. Or some other purpose.",
      "\"Reach for\" is correct. It implies an intention for the reaching. The hand is reaching to grab the remote.\n\n\"Reach to\" doesn't have this implication. If you said a hand \"reached to\" a remote, it sounds like you're describing the distance the hand reached, like, \"The hand reached as far as the remote.\"",
      "If the hand is reaching to pick up the remote, it would be \"for\".\n\nIf the hand was just stretching to see how far it could reach, and the remote was merely being used as a sort of landmark, it could be \"to\".  But that seems like a rare and unusual thing to want to say.",

      "This definition is very strange. \"Deceptively\" is often used to describe size but that's not implied in the word. You could have a deceptively delicious meal or meet a deceptively smart person. It's describing a thing that has more of a quality than you'd assume it to at first glance.",
      "It just means misleading.\n\nThe fact they use smaller and greater in the examples has little to do with the definition.\n\nI could say deceptively smart. Just means smarter than I thought.\n\nI could say that minivan was deceptively fast. I thought it would be slow because it's a minivan, but it's surprisingly fast.",
      "That's a weird definition and it's causing you to think about this word wrong. It doesn't mean either 'smaller' or 'bigger' on its own — it means that something is the 'opposite' of what you would expect.\n\nIf something is 'deceptively small' it means that it has characteristics of something big, small's opposite. If something is 'deceptively big' it means that it has characteristics of something small, big's opposite.\n\nIf someone is 'deceptively friendly' they seem nice but secretly are not nice.\n\nIf a concept is 'deceptively simple' it \\*seems\\* simple, but has unexpected complexity.",
      "Because \"deceptively\" is an adverb, it all depends on what it is describing.

      "This word generally doesn't refer to size in particular.\n\nNotice it's \"smaller\" and _\"greater\",_ it's about the proportion or scale of a thing or action.\n\nEven then, this is a strange definition. Deception is more about lying or misdirection, not necessarily confusing the proportion or scale of something, though that is a way something can be deceptive.",

Does the sentence *The pool is deceptively shallow* mean that the pool is shallower or deeper than it appears? Is it apparently shallow, but not really, or is it actually shallow but only looks deep? Thus, a *deceptively complex* person might be either complex or simple, depending on the point of view. The meaning of *deceptively* is thus very dependent upon the context, and writers should be careful to ensure that the word cannot be misinterpreted or avoid it entirely.\n\nAnother blog post on the subject: https://www.grammarunderground.com/deceptively-simple.html",
      "that's a bad definition. What dictionary are you using? \n\n\nTo deceive is to mislead, lie to, or hide [something] from someone.\n\n\nDeceptive is an adjective referring to someone who does that.\n\n\nDeceptively is an adverb describing \"doing an action in a way that deceives\"\n\n\n\"deceptively small\" means \"small, but doesn't look small\"\n\n\n\"deceptively large\" means \"large, but doesn't look large\"\n\n\n\"She's deceptively kind\" means \"she doesn't seem like a kind person, but really is\"",
      "\"Deceptively\" doesn't really mean \"bigger or smaller\" or \"less or more.\" It means something like, \"Contrary to what you would assume.\"\n\nYou could say, \"The interior of the tent is deceptively large,\" meaning you expected the inside to seem smaller based on how the tent looked on the outside. You could replace \"large\" with \"small\" and it'd just mean the opposite. You could also write the sentence like this. \"Contrary to what you may assume given the apparent size of the tent from the outside, the interior is rather spacious.\" That's way more words than you need to use.\n\nI can't really think of many real-life scenarios with ambiguous uses of \"deceptively.\" You could say, \"This product is deceptively priced,\" which could either mean it's more or less expensive than you may expect. In this case, you'd look at the item, and if it looks expensive, it's probably cheap, and if it looks cheap, it's probably expensive.",
      "You will be able to understand the meaning through context.\n\n Deceptively is just a way of saying something isn't as described.

I ___ (eat) sushi for the first time in 2020.\nAnswer: I ate sushi for the first time in 2020.\nExplanation: “2020” is a finished time in the past, so we use Past Simple.\n\n\n2.

We ___ (have) dinner at 6 p.m. yesterday.\nAnswer: We had dinner at 6 p.m. yesterday.\nExplanation: “Yesterday” is a finished time, so we use Past Simple.\n\n\n4. They ___ (not finish) their homework yet.\nAnswer: They haven’t finished their homework yet.\nExplanation: “Yet” shows the action is not finished, so we use Present Perfect.\n\n---\n\n📝 Try it With Me (Mini Exercises)\n\nCan you choose the correct tense?\n\n1.

      "Thanks so much for your feedback!\n\nJust to clarify — the instructions said “choose the correct tense,” and the base form of the verb was provided. That usually means more than one word might be needed (like an auxiliary + verb), which is pretty standard in grammar exercises and most learning materials.\n\nAs for “We haven’t met before today” — it may not be super common in spoken English, but it’s still grammatically correct. The focus of this post was grammar practice, not spoken fluency or common phrasing. For learners, both are important — but they serve different purposes. :)\n\nI appreciate your perspective! It’s just important to consider the context of the exercise and the instructions before judging whether something is “good” or “bad” English. In this case, the goal was to help learners practice tense usage accurately — even if that means using forms that are less common in everyday speech.

      "The part I disagree with is not a badly phrased question or an unnatural sentence. My disagreement solely focuses on the opinion that one single gap intuitively asks only for one single word, whereas it’s often clearly stated in the task that a certain tense should be formed. Students then need to know whether they have to add a have/has for the Present Perfect or not. It is very common to only have one single (big) gap, one verb in brackets and the task that asks for a tense which might need a second word.",

      "“Much is made lately of” = “recently, people are talking a lot about” or “recently, people keep making a big deal out of”\n\nThe unrealized gains / tax avoidance thing is all about tax laws, and how it’s possible to use certain strategies to avoid paying taxes or to pay less in taxes. \n\nHe is using the passive voice, and I could say more but it would probably violate the rules of this sub.",
      "The noun \"Much\" is the direct object of the predicate \"is made\". The phrase is in the passive voice, so \"much is made\" but the actor is not identified. (Active voice would be something like \"People make much lately of...\") The word \"lately\" is an adverb that modifies the predicate.\n\n\"Much is made\" in this sense means \"Somebody is saying that this is important.\"\n\nThe rest from \"of\" is a prepositional phrase descriptive to tell you what they making much of.  The word \"being\" is a gerund and what follows is the complement of \"unrealized gains\".\n\nADDED: Another way to unwind this:\n\nSome people are emphatically claiming lately that unrealized gains are a means of tax avoidance, so....",
      "Here's a breakdown of the meaning of the phrases:\n\n* [**Much is made of** ](https://dictionary.cambridge.org/us/dictionary/english/make-much-of#google_vignette)\\-- a lot of importance is given to\n* [**unrealized gains**](https://www.investopedia.com/ask/answers/04/021204.asp) **--**   a potential profit that exists on paper\n* **a means of tax avoidance --** a way of not paying taxes\n\nGrammatically, the clause breaks down like this:\n\n* **Much**: subject\n* **is made of**: verb phrase\n* **lately**: adverb\n* **unrealized gains**: noun phrase\n* **being a means of tax avoidance**: gerund phrase\n\nAccording to prescriptive grammar, \"unrealized gains\" should be a [**possessive**](https://www.grammarflip.com/curriculum/possessive-use-with-gerunds/), so it should read: \"unrealized gains' being a means of tax avoidance.\"",
      "To begin with, that first part is called a clause, not a sentence. A sentence is a clause that ends with a period, not a comma, while a clause is just an idea.\n\n\nAnyway, \"much is made of\" is a derivative of making a big deal of something, meaning something is of significant attention recently or it is relevant right now, typically with a complaining connotation.\n\n\nElon Musk is saying since there is a fuss about capital gains and unrealized gains (a form of wealth) being used to avoid tax, so he will sell 10% of his stock (which will incur tax).",
      "\"Much is made of\" is a set phrase. It can be used in a variety of tenses and with a lot of adjectives, but in general it means \"there has been a lot of discussion on this topic\".",
      "A lot has been said and/or done about unrealized gains being a method of tax avoidance recently. It should really be “much has been made lately of unrealized gains…” lots of attention has been given to this method of tax avoidance which is unrealized gains.",
      "Do not learn English from Elon muskrat. He can barley speak it himself ",
      "Nobody here seems to be commenting on this fact, but what Musk wrote isn't right.\n\n\nIt should be:\n\n\n> Much is **being** made lately of unrealized gains being a means of tax avoidance...\n\n\nOr \n\n\n> Much is made ~~lately~~ of unrealized gains being a means of tax avoidance...\n\nWhat Musk is saying isn't aggressively incorrect, but just isn't right.",
      "You got straight to the whole context in just 2 sentences, wonderful",
      "Thank you! But why it will violate the sub rule?",
      "As I tell my students, one of the main reasons to use the passive voice at all is to avoid claiming or attributing responsibility (“mistakes were made” is my go-to example.) \n\nThat’s pure English leaning, not politics: one’s own conclusions may be drawn.",
      "To give more context of how the tax avoidance scheme works, what obscenely rich people do instead of cashing out their gains is get a loan against their shares.  That's how they can effectively spend the money without selling the underlying assets and incurring a tax bill.  Then when they run out of the loan money they simply get another loan to pay the first loan back and then spend that until they have to get another, and so on forever.  The rich guy winds up paying just some small loan interest rate instead of all the taxes, and that money goes to the bank instead of the government.",
      "I think technically it should be “much is *being* made of…” \n\nThat would be more correct",
      "> “unrealized gains” should be a possessive\n\nI just wanted to add that while this might be “proper” grammar, I think most people today would agree that it sounds unnatural in most cases. Using one of the examples from the site you linked, “Did your mother agree to *our having* a sleepover tonight?” sounds pretentious to me at best. I’m sure you already know this, I just wanted to point it out for OP and any other learners reading this.",
      "\"unrealized gains\" is potential profit or increased value which the person has not cashed out; it is plural, not possessive.\n\nTo \"realize\" a gain the person has to liquidate the asset. While it is just on a spreadsheet but still tied up as stocks, property, or other asset it is \"unrealized\" (in this context, \"realize\" is a synonym for activated, tangible, etc)"

      "If I heard her speaking irl and wasn't paying that much attention and didn't talk with her that much, personally I'd probably think she was a native speaker with some weird speech impediment.

Weirdly, they’re probably too well enunciated. \n\nNative speakers would swallow the sound more so habit becomes more like hab’t.",

It's a bit *too* precise in some spots and a bit foreign in others.  \n\nThat said, she is completely understandable and her accent is quite good.  \n\nIf somebody lied to me and told me that she born and raised in America, I'd have no idea where in the U.S. such an accent could possibly be from--not Boston, not New York, not midwestern, not southern, etc.--so I'd have a difficult time accepting her accent as \"American\".",
      "She’s very good and very fluent, but her accent comes through in some words.",
      "Some of the sentences sound potentially native but some definitely give it away",
      "She sounds like a Ukrainian who speaks English very well. It isn't a bad thing to have an accent when speaking English.  We all do (whether from Peoria, Illinios, or Bath, England). She speaks English very clearly, but she does not sound American.",
      "Really really good accent but there are small things you can notice like when she says “habit” she voices the t making it sound like “habid”",
      "She speaks well, but there is a hint of a foreign accent in there.",
      "Feel like I’m crazy for thinking she can pass as a native for the most part. \n\nI feel like a lot of these comments went into the video specifically looking for things that would give away her not being native. If they didn’t know beforehand I think the responses could be different",
      "Like everyone is saying, her English is excellent. I would go so far as to say it would probably take a few minutes of conversation to realize she’s not American. But I would notice eventually, because the accent is sneaking through on certain words. This is still a fantastic command of not only language, but accent. Exceptional.",
      "Her American accent is very good. If I were just having a conversation with her I might not notice right away. But when you ask me ahead of time whether her accent sounds native, I listen in a different way. There are a few subtle tells that she's not native.  \n  \n\"develop\" the second \"e\" is pronounced like a long \"a\"  \n\"two\" sounds almost like \"tyoo\"  \n\"habit\" the \"t\" is not stopped  \n\"memorize information\" the \"z\" is not fully voiced and \"information\" is over-pronounced  \n\"routine\" sounds like \"ra-TEEN\" where most Americans say \"ROO-TEEN\" without a strong emphasis on either syllable",
      "There's a level of nasality in her speech that gives it an unnatural feeling. The accent itself is in the vowels you use and how you transition between vowel sounds and consonants. English might be the worst for this because we have tons of vowel forms (different ways to use A or E sounds etc), but 0 notation in written language to inform the reader of what they should say.\n\nRather than AN other thing, she says Uh nother thing. She also draws out some words as she annunciates them like routine or \"routiiiine\". If you want a super natural accent, try to pay attention to syllable stress when people pronounce words. stressing the wrong part of the word will make it hard for people to understand you. Imagine if say, with the word understand, you stressed DER. unDERstand. Generally you can get away without any stress in most cases, but sometimes its necessary.\n\nGet your vowels right, look for how native speakers stress words, watch some TV, and I believe anyone can arrive at a comfortable accent. That said, I don't think aspiring to an average American/English accent is worth it or necessary",

      "I’m not a teacher but I have a few tips:\n\nFocus on fixing one thing at a time. For example, if you want to get better at using comma, google comma rules. It would give you a dozen rules and exceptions. That’s too much to learn at once. So pick one rule. Try to practice and apply it when writing. When you feel you nail it every time for about a week or two, move on to the next rule.\n\nAs for writing, what do you want to write? There’s a sub called r/writeStreakEN. You can write and post it there for corrections.\n\nFor fiction, the rules are different. Write fiction through action and you try to evoke emotion in readers. So don’t summarize, don’t explain, don’t jump to conclusions. Lay it all out and let readers decide how they should feel about it. Don’t tell readers what they should feel or what the characters feel.",
      "Practice. I recommend keeping an English diary. Write about what you do every day. You can start with simple sentences and work up to more complex sentences using this, as it's such a broad topic. Also when you have to look up a new word for your diary, write it underneath the entry with the definition.\n\nFor grammar I highly recommend Raymond Murphy's Grammar in Use series. There are three difficulty levels, have lots of great information and practice exercises with an answer key in the back so you can self study.",

You memorize stuff much better when you really have to go through the entire process, compared to when you just look it up on Google translate or smth \n\n-Check online, there are a lot of resources, that might help you with that (unfortunately the ones I use are specifically for learning french, so I can't recommend them to you)\n\n\n-Just copy stuff/journal (I think someone already mentioned the journaling thing but it's a really good idea)",

Then, move on to bigger structures. \n\nIf you write three good sentences, then you have a paragraph. If you write four good paragraphs, then you have a short text.\n\nMost writing in English is highly structured and it can be done by using a step by step method. Just learn a couple of those structures (essay structure, short story structure, opinion piece structure, etc) and then fill them with whatever you want to write about.\n\nIt takes a bit of practice at first, but after a couple of times it starts coming automatically.

    "text": "American journalism is peppered with **“scrappy”** sports teams and business entities. Always with approval, for readiness to compete head-to-head on unequal terms with intimidating rivals.\n\nApparently if I call a team “scrappy” in British English, I just said that they’re slipshod, disorganized, and an unfinished mess of ill-assorted parts.\n\nIs that really the way of it, or do the dictionaries need updating? \n\nThe related sense of the noun form ‘scrap’ is supposed to be common everywhere. Citation in the pic is from Oxford.\n\n",
    "comments": [
      "Can’t speak for the Brits, but in America it’s a little of both. A scrappy team is determined and pugnacious (definition 2) but also a bit of an underdog and unpolished (akin to definition 1). Someone who is scrappy likely lacks funds and/or proper, disciplined training and therefore relies on sheer persistence and doggedness to succeed.\n\nEdit for typo",
      "“Scrappy” has been part of American media culture for a long time. It’s usually used to describe a young, inexperienced, determined underdog , who succeeds through unconventional means. \n\nIt’s kind of embarrassing that large companies have started to use it to describe themselves, since they are definitely not the underdog. But I didn’t know Brits would think it’s an insult.",
      "As a Brit, yeah \"scrappy\" doesn't sound like a compliment to me.",
      "Scrappy usually refers to the underdog, hence Scrappy Doo",
      "I've mostly heard scrappy as refering to a small or scrawny person who uses agility to win physical fights.",
      "I'm British, the dictionary is correct. I didn't know meaning 2 of \"scrappy\" until reading this post, I think I have come across it before and not understood it.",
      "Seems like it must be a British vs American thing.\n\nIn the US, it implies someone who will do things that are not pleasant or proper to reach their goal, but it can be positive or negative.\n\nBut it does seem like it’s more derogatory for the Brits.",
      "In British English, it depends on context.  In sports, particularly football, a ‘scrappy’ game is untidy and not beautiful, but competitive.  Commentators frequently use the verb:  “It wasn’t a good performance, United had to scrap to get a result.”  \nOutside of sport, for example in business English, it’s not commonly used and only with the ‘disorganised’ meaning.",
      "Words with “ie”s or “y”s at the end are hard to describe because they sort of mean the base word but apppied to a larger concept. I’m a native speaker and I always took the word scrappy as being from the verb scrap which is like a little fight/disagreement “they had a little scrap” scrappy just means they are… like a scrap. There scrappy. You can really apply this to most words. you can take a noun or verb put an “ee” sound at the end and make in an adjective “they’re butterflyee” (that’s not a word but just for an example) or “they’re glowy” or “they’re pasty” which would mean “they’re like paste” or “they sort of glow” or “they’re scrappy” which doesn’t necessarily mean they get in lots of fights just that they have the characteristics of scraps/little arguments/fights.",
      "As far as North American English, calling someone scrappy in a competitive sense is a bit more like saying they have a sense of enginuity. They take what they can get. The scraps. To scrap is to fight more or less, but isn't particularly related to scrap (as in trash, stuff).",
      "There is that rough and ready flavor, but at least in my head “scrappy newcomer” implies nothing about their preparation or lack of it — only their predisposition to fight…",
      "Scrappy always gives me the impression of like an Irish orphan with that hat, and he's got a bandaid on his face and looking for a fight. Not necessarily an insult on its own to be that way, but compared to like a posh person, he'd be seen as unrefined. ",
      "Thanks. The OED remains undefeated and in no sense scrappy.",
      "Thank you! Maybe this reflects a two-centuries-old US preference for grit over style. Generalizing about the USA is a little painful today.",
      "As you said, that’s in your head. If you say “scrappy newcomer,” most Americans will take that to mean that the person does not have the advantage of formal training.\n\nPugnacious and combative are words that avoid that connotation altogether and just focus on the willingness to fight."

Has this particular dog been vaccinated, or will that happen later this week, or at some other time? It sounds a bit anxious - this thing is supposed to happen, but has it in fact happened, or are you behind schedule???\n\nWhen reporting the kinds of questions you should think about or ask during the process, *already* is much more natural. You need to know if the dogs come pre-vaccinated when you adopt them. You don’t particularly care about *when* that happened, or whether it happened on time, or late, or whatever, which is the implication of *yet.*",
      "As others have said, you could ask \"Are the dogs vaccinated yet?\"   This would mean about the same thing as the original.\n\nBut \"Are the dogs yet vaccinated\" not only sounds antiquated, it would mean \"are the dogs *still* vaccinated?\"  As though you know the dogs were previously vaccinated and you are worried that they have somehow become unvaccinated.",

      "“If the dogs are already vaccinated” would be more correct but yes already is right yet would sound very strange (you need a “the” because I’m pretty sure you arnt asking if every dog that has ever existed has been vacinated)",

      "Those list items are technically NOT sentences. That being said, \"already\" is correct. \"Yet\" would be incorrect if left in the existing word order.",

      "You may hear (likely older) people say he/she (pronounced as \"he slash she\" even), but that's pretty outdated use at this point. Many people who insist it must be \"he/she\" instead of \"they\" do so out of stubbornness against folks who prefer to go by \"they\" rather than a gendered pronoun.",
      "'they' is also used for a single person of unspecified gender, using the same conjugations as though it were plural; 'they are' not 'they is' (though you may hear 'they is' occasionally, in certain dialects of english.)\n\nAlso, in extremely formal speech (like, laws, contracts, butler characters on TV, stuff like that), 'one' might be used as well. i.e. 'if one were to fall off a building, would one survive?' In this way, 'one' conjugates the same way as 'he' and 'she'; 'one is' not 'one are'.",
      "“They” is used when you don’t know or when you are talking about more than one person.",
      "Use “they”. He and she are gendered (masculine and feminine), and “it” is only used for things like inanimate objects rather than people. So “they” is the correct choice",
      "In addition to singular \"they,\" English also has the indefinite pronoun \"one\" which you may use in place of \"a person\" in such cases. E.g., your second example could be written \"if one falls off a building...\"",
      "Many people default to whichever gender they are themselves, I call anybody \"he\" in a hypothetical where the gender is unspecified, but in cases where I just can't really tell for certain what their gender is, then I say \"they\"",
      "always use they if you don’t know the gender.",
      "*They* is the simplest answer. Before singular *they* became acceptable in formal English, but after epicene *he* became controversial, we had to avoid using pronouns or change the nouns to grammatical plurals.",
      "They",
      "Singular they is always correct where referring to an indefinite (\"generic\"/nonspecific/unknown) person, as in the examples you give. \n\nYou will sometimes see or hear people just pick either 'he' or 'she' and that's understood just fine, but it tends to reinforce unfortunate gender stereotypes (such as defaulting to \"he\" for any surgeon and \"she\" for any nurse) so it's better to avoid that unless the context makes the sex or gender of the person you're referring to relevant.  For example, if you're discussing patient care standards after a vasectomy, it's reasonable to refer to the generic patient as \"he\".\n\nSingular they can also be used, but is not always the best choice, if you're referring to a specific individual, but you don't happen to know their gender.  Again, context is important.  If this person is someone you will have an ongoing relationship with, ask their pronouns and refer to them accordingly.  But if you mean the total stranger who just drove past you, and for whatever reason you want it to be immediately clear that you mean the driver only, not everyone who was in the car, it's fine to take your best guess based on the person's appearance and say something like \"did you see his hat?\"  It hurts no one if your guess happened to be incorrect."

Building sentences feels like playing Jenga, but at least I stopped saying “I is tired.” Progress. \n* **Vocabulary** – Learning around 15 words per day. “Window” is my friend now. “Through” still looks down on me. \n* **Reading** – I’m not afraid of short sentences anymore. I can read basic texts without panicking. \n* **Writing** – I’m sticking to simple sentences. Still tense-confused, but at least I’m not typing “Dear Sir or Madım” anymore. \n* **Listening & Speaking** – Listening was attempted for 2 minutes. Speaking didn’t even show up. We’re not emotionally ready to face each other yet.\n\n  \n**Goals for Next Week (no ears or mouth involved):**\n\n* **Reading** – Reach page 20 in my first English book\n* **Vocabulary** – Raise my daily word goal from 15 to 20\n* **Grammar** – Lock in the first 6 tenses\n* **Writing** – One short email + two mini journal entries\n\n  \n**Final Note:**\n\nLearning a language isn’t always aesthetic.

    "title": "Need urgent advice ‼️My 10-year-old sister missed a lot of school due to health issues. She only knows the English alphabet. How can I help her catch up fast?",
    "text": "\nHi everyone,\nI really need some help and guidance.\n\nMy sister is 10 years old, but due to serious health problems, she hasn’t been able to attend school regularly. As a result, she’s extremely behind in English as second language. She only knows the alphabet. that’s it. No vocabulary, no reading, no writing, no speaking. Meanwhile, her classmates are way ahead, reading, writing paragraphs, and speaking fluently. She’s feeling left behind, frustrated, and helpless.\n\nWhat’s worse is that she really wants to learn. She’s trying, but the gap is just huge and overwhelming for her.\n\nIm pretty good at English, doing BA English language and literature and I have zero teaching experience, but I want to help her catch up as much as possible over the next 2-3 months, enough so she can start reading simple sentences and maybe speak some basic English confidently. I know that’s ambitious, but I’m willing to dedicate serious time and effort every day.\n\nThese are my concerns;-\n\n–How can I structure a daily routine for her?\n\n–What are the most effective tools/apps/videos/resources for this level?\n\n–How do I keep her motivated when she feels like giving up?\n\n–How much progress is realistic in 2-3 months if we work on it daily?\n\nIf anyone’s been in a similar situation or knows what works best for absolute beginners, please share. I’m determined to help her, and I really appreciate any advice or resource you can offer.\n\nThank you!\n\n\n",

      "This is honestly beyond anyone without specific training. Your sister needs a professional.",
      "If you are serious about helping your sister then you will get her a tutor, someone not related to her. She won't study as effectively if you take on this role.",
      "While you're deciding what to do, download Teach Your Monster to Read. Join in until she can get round the English instructions. She needs phonics before she needs anything else.",
      "I agree with others that it's best if someone else does the teaching, I teach English to adults and even married couples don't always do well in the same class together, it's not always good for their relationship.\n\nBut, I think there are ways you could be supportive. You could offer (with her permission) to use English as your primary language together. But: No teaching, no correcting mistakes, only positive reinforcement and patience! Give her a few phrases she can say \"How do you say ----?\" \"Repeat?\", write them down on notecard, even better if she writes the phonetic spelling below it, however it sounds phonetically to her. You could watch English tiktoks or shows together, you could have English karaoke nights. You could watch and follow along to Yoga with Adriene or any other fitness youtuber in English, you could follow cooking/crafting tutorials together in English. Keep it fun!",
      "If she's already getting help from school and teachers, perhaps you can support her in less formal, more enjoyable ways.  Have short conversations with her in English while you cook or eat, find some fun books you can read together, watch English language TV.  There are a lot of ESL resources online for games and quizzes.  Keep it light and she will grow in confidence with your support.",
      "Don't hasten it. From my experience, in public schools (at least in Russia), English isn't taught that well, and scores don't affect anything. I started with the language just before I went to high school. Try different methods, and teach her the language without aiming at catching up with her classmates and the curriculum. For reference, I used to study French, and I would usually do great, despite that I barely spoke it.",
      "Which country are you in? Are you in an English speaking country or one where English isn't an official language? How is the school system structured? From which grade on do they learn English? Which grade is she in currently? \n\nI'm from Germany and we did have some English in the last year of kindergarten and also in grade 3 and 4 of primary school, but it only really started to get serious in grade 5 after the switch to secondary school. I only really knew how to count and the colours in primary school and some simple phrases. \n\nIf English is the second language taught in school and she is still in primary school, secondary school might give her a sort of fresh start with a new teacher and new classmates.",
      "I would recommended leaving the classroom style learning to the teacher. She can tell the teacher that her brother is helping her learn and ask for activitiesyou two can do together, or you can ask the teacher for them. \n\n\nYou say she's motivated. I wouldn't try to structure her whole study for her since you're her brother, not her teacher or her parent, but instead do something like give her an hour or two a day of your time. Maybe two or three thirty minute blocks because it gets hard to concentrate if you're trying to learn non-stop for too long, especially for a kid. During those times, practice the stuff she's learning from her teacher, watch English language media together and talk about them (kids shows or kids learning channels, maybe), and once she knows enough English that she can make simple sentences, play games or do activities together where you both speak as much English as possible, even if for week one that's only you telling her the words for stuff. Repeating similar activities, like a favorite game or daily chores, will really help because the same words will keep coming up. \n\n\n\n\n\n\nAs far as motivation goes, when you hear her doing things well, tell her. When you notice that she's using words and grammatical structures that she didn't know the previous week, tell her you're noticing her improvement. Be her supportive friend and her practice buddy rather than a second teacher. ",
      "Intensive reading sessions. And I’m not kidding ",
      "I think the best way is by communicating with her in English , you said she only knows alphabets right?  \nTherefore, show her pictures of certain animals, flowers and other stuff and tell her names, and then slowly build-up sentences in English. There are loads of animated videos on YT also for children to learn and understand as well as enjoy English, Important part is grammar which becomes easier with communication.  \nAnd don't make it like a necessary thing for her, even though it is. Try to make it more fun so she gets more indulged in learning the language. By telling her fun stories, or a poem. That could help a lot.",
      "It’s really tough when you want to learn but everything feels overwhelming. I was in a similar spot when I first started learning English just staring at textbooks like “how does ANYONE understand this??”\n\nSince she knows the alphabet, maybe start with **super basic phonics**? Like, how letters sound together (e.g., “cat” = c-a-t). There are great YouTube channels for this Super Simple English and English Singsing have cute, slow videos for kids. For apps, **Duolingo Kids** or **Lingokids** might feel less “babyish” but still simple enough.\n\nFor routine, maybe **30 mins daily** broken into:\n\n* 10 mins phonics/videos\n* 10 mins writing (copying words, then simple sentences like “I like apples”)\n* 10 mins speaking (repeat after videos, or label things in your house!)\n\nMotivation is HARD. Celebrate tiny wins like if she reads a word alone! I stuck stars on my wall for every 10 new words I learned lol. Also, **picture dictionaries** helped me a ton when starting.\n\nProgress-wise, in 2-3 months she could definitely read short sentences and speak basics if you’re consistent!\n\nYou’re an awesome sibling for helping her like this! She’ll get there, just go slow and keep it fun. 💪 Let us know how it goes!",
      "Let her watch English shows. Whatever she is interested in as a 10 year old. This is the best way to learn faster. This will slowly and surely show in her listening, speech, and finally in her reading and writing.",
      "Move to a rural part of an English speaking country. It isn’t likely to be convenient or cheap, but it should get the job done. Sink or swim. This will be the absolute fastest method because necessity is the mother of invention.",
      "Does she have stuffed animals? (Or some other toys.) You could teach her things about them, like \"\\[Name\\] is a \\[animal\\].\" \"\\[Name\\] is \\[color\\].\" Get some basic vocabulary down and then you can make two sets of cards and use them to play Go Fish, and practice \"Do you have....?\"  I don't think it hurts to practice some things just verbally.",
      "hey - i don't know that this will be the SINGLE BEST way of learning, but I built a bot you can message in WhatsApp to get stories + quizzes. So your sister could come and ask for a very very basic story in English, and answer some questions about that? We use streaks to keep people incentivised. DM if interested - totally FREE, as we're still looking for feedback."

    "text": "Does anyone know some reasonably hard exercises for prepositions. Okay this might be difficult, but there are some prepositions that are 'sounding' weird, like appearing incorrect to me as a Dutchman, but are correct in English. Example, I got this one wrong:\n\nAntidote to\n\nIn Dutch that would be tegengif, and you would say tegengif voor (for) or perhaps tegengif tegen (against), but definitely not tegengif tot (closest translation to 'to' in Dutch).\n\nAny idea? Any exercises on line? Any hints how to prevent these mistakes?",
    "comments": [
      "Prepositions are such a pain, especially when they don’t translate directly from your native language. I’m a Spanish speaker, and I still mess up stuff like \"on the weekend\" vs. \"at the weekend\" (turns out the first one’s more common in AmE, and the second in BrE who knew?).\n\nFor tricky ones like \"antidote to,\" I’ve found it helps to memorize them as fixed phrases. Like, \"solution to,\" \"answer to,\" and \"antidote to\" all follow the same pattern. Maybe try making flashcards with the whole phrase instead of just the preposition?\n\nAs for exercises, I’ve used this site before: [EnglishPage.com Prepositions](https://www.englishpage.com/prepositions/prepositions.html). The advanced ones get pretty tough! Also, just reading a lot (books, news, etc.) helps you absorb which prepositions \"sound\" right over time.",
      "I don't have an answer for the question you asked, however I'd like to chime in as a native American English speaker (midwest and mountain west United States). To my ear, 'to' sounds uncomfortable and I prefer 'for.'\n\n\"I wish I had an antidote for hangovers\" is correct. 'Against' could work, but it feels like you're taking a little too much poetic license. 'To' is just plain wrong and sounds non-native to me.\n\nFlipping the script, it would be... just barely acceptable to say \"antivenin doesn't work as an antidote to snake venom.\" 'Against' would be fine here, but 'for' is again my preference.\n\nThe only time (that I can think of offhand) where 'to' is preferred is in situations like, \"deliver this antidote to the man in black.\"",
      "I try to remind students about the weekend thing. But I agree about prepositions. They are difficult, and the best way is to learn them as whole phrases.",
      "Ah well I found it in a British preparation exam. Cambridge exam. Let me find the quote:\n\n\"When we consider that addiction to the Internet is becoming a real social problem and increasing numbers of people are undertaking a ‘digital cleanse’ in order to escape from the stresses of the Internet age, it seems clear that books can provide a welcome antidote (7) \\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_  screen time.\"\n\nMy first answer was 'against', my second 'for' then revealing the correct answer it appeared to be 'to'. Which kind of surprised me.\n\nI do know that the use of prepositions can even very among regional dialects, also in Dutch.\n\nAlso it's a computer website that gives you the correct answer so probably there is only one correct one in the machine, while a human teacher would revise the answers more generous.",
      "Huh, fancy that. In the excerpt you provided from the exam, 'to' does seem to flow quite well when I read it. That said, I'd have also gotten this one wrong, so (at least in the context of AmE) I wouldn't stress your *technical error* too much- both of your initial choices would have conveyed fluency to me.\n\nFrankly, these higher level exams would likely have many native speakers stumped too. I like the suggestion from the other commenter here about flash cards with word strings instead of working with each standalone element, but assure you that you're on a great path- and as best I can tell, seem to think in conversational English, not stuffy collegiate thesis English, haha.\n\nAs an aside, in your last paragraph, consider shifting 'probably' to the right, as in '...so there is probably only one...' for AmE. Or... maybe simply ignore my suggestions from both this reply and my initial one altogether; I get the impression you may well have a more scholarly understanding of my native tongue than I do. ;)",
      "\"these higher level exams would likely have many native speakers stumped too\"\n\nI know. I am doing Cambridge C1 and C2, and there where some analytical questions in reading where I knew every English word, but still was puzzled what the answer should be! If it were written in Dutch I would still have made the same mistakes at a few of those questions."

    "comments": [
      "Writing can be so frustrating sometimes, especially when other skills feel stronger. 😅 I’ve been trying to improve mine too, and one thing that’s helped me is keeping a small notebook (or even just a notes app) for phrases/expressions I encounter on a daily basis like from books, shows, or even Reddit posts. Then I try to use them in my own sentences later.\n\nAlso, maybe try writing short paragraphs (even just 2-3 sentences) about your day or random thoughts? It’s less pressure than long essays, and you can focus on making those few sentences as clear/natural as possible.",
      "Hey! 👋🏻 It’s great that you’re already reading, writing, and learning vocab — that’s a solid start. Here are some things that might help you further:\n\n\n1) Find short, high-quality paragraphs (from Cambridge sample essays, blogs, or articles) and try to imitate the structure. This helps you absorb how strong writing feels — like sentence flow, connectors, and tone.\n\n\n2) Take one paragraph you wrote and spend 15 minutes improving it. Replace weak words (like “bad” or “thing”), fix sentence order, and connect your ideas better. The better you get at recognizing weak spots, the faster you’ll be able to do that while writing.\n\n\n3) Instead of memorizing single words, collect useful expressions like:\n\n\n“In contrast to…”\n“One major issue is…”\n“This suggests that…”\n\n\nThen build 1–2 sentences using each one. You’ll retain vocabulary much better when you put the words into practice.\n\n\n4) Find a tutor to check your writing, post it on Reddit, or even paste it into ChatGPT and ask:\n\"Does this sound natural? How can I improve this paragraph?\"\n\n\n5) Speak your ideas aloud, then turn them into proper paragraphs. It helps you write more fluently and naturally. (This one worked best for me when I was starting and preparing for my Cambridge exam.)\n\n\nHope some of this helps you! 😊",
      "I’d recommend a journal or diary and a dictionary (online or physical). \nIt’s a good way to get the words you use most and practice using them in sentences.\n\nAnother good way to learn is reading some English writing and paying attention to words and grammar you don’t know/understand. News articles, books, whatever it is you find interesting should work. (Except maybe social media because grammar and spelling can be a bit iffy in less formal settings. It’s not bad for learning informal speech though.)",

      "The average native English vocabulary is something like 7500-10,000 words. It’s difficult to quantify exactly, but this is the general range most people seem to settle on. When you distill that down to the average spoken vocabulary, it’s basically a third or less. Native speakers are “guessing” based on context clues as often as you are. Possibly more often. \n\nI am always amused at how regularly some super advanced non-native English speaker comes in here worried about how being in the 99th percentile isn’t good enough, just because they don’t realize they’re in the 99th percentile. \n\nThat said, don’t stop practicing. I think your vocabulary self-quiz idea is a good one.",
      "It happens to me in English and I’m a native speaker. It comes down to the simple fact that there are some words you just aren’t going to use all that often if you never use them or get into conversations where the subject will conjure up those certain words. \n\nThe key is to learn the word and to use it in a sentence that you speak verbally. There is something about recognizing a word, reading the word, writing down the word and then using it often in a sentence that allows your brain to truly remember it and how it’s used. \n\nIt sounds to me like you don’t live somewhere where there are native English speakers. I’d truly suggest finding someone online with whom you can have a phone conversation. Have them use certain words that you just learnt and see how they say them. Then you should try using those words in a sentence with them.",
      "Active recall in action",
      "Yeah, like the other people said, generally you want to be familiar with general words for “categories”. Such as knowing what “bad” means so you can parse out context for synonyms or words with slightly different meanings. It’s better to understand at least a little bit of everything than trying to understand each individual word. Knowing that “horrible” generally has the same type of context as “bad” and other similar concepts will take you far. Also you can just as for a specific word’s meaning, as even native English speakers need a synonym every once in a while.",
      "Thanks! Tools out there are crazy and they help a lot! ANd your words gave me hope again :)",
      "Rn i learn new words by quizzes, like i use dende .ai eg, and it gets much easier that way. also started practicing new ways too!",

The video is basically the Cristiano Ronaldo, gettin' up of his chair before  the result of the award, or be, he already knew that he was the winner right? But how can y'all can see in title of this video, isn't \"bro knows he is a winner\" or \"he knows he is a winner\" but is \"bro knows you are a winner\", why don't \"he\" instead \"you\" this don't make sense 'cause the \"you\" refer to CR7 but this seems that is saying about who is watchin' the video, somebody can explain to me, the meaning of this title and the why is \"you\" instead \"he\" (I'm from brazil, so if you can translate, thanks)",
    "comments": [
      "One thing first. It should be ‘I was curious because the title doesn’t make sense’. You are correct in a strict sense of English usage. However this is colloquial English and therefore the rules get broken. What they are saying is ‘bro knows he’s the winner’ but they have also dropped the ‘when’ so it would then read ‘when bro knows you’s the winner’, ugly but it’s colloquial so it doesn’t conform. Hope that helps.",

      "I could be mistaken in my understanding of the context, however yes. It would seem HE knows that HE is a winner. \"You\" would refer to the viewer, as if this were a motivational video. You've got it right!\n\n\nAlso, in times where you want to say something is or isn't (something), you wouldn't say \"don't\". Don't is about what something is doing, or what is has (excluding when refering to someone in third person singular.

Its just when I read this, the don'ts through me for a loop for half a sec ",
      "its probably wrong",
      "So, they dropped the when right? but anyway doesnt make sense (I think) because the you refer to who is watching the video right?",
      "So, this means like \"when you know you are the winner?\" So, bro refer to \"you\" right? Is like he wanted to say \"when you know you are the winner\" like, when you know that anyway you already won right? Or bro refer to another subject?",
      "Yeah I know this, but I only was passing the videos and appeared this, and I stayed curious, you know what the meaning of this title and why \"he\" and doesn't \"you\"?",
      "oh yes this must be it so its like showing how your friend will react",
      "Oh yeah, but I didn't understand, why isn't \"bro knows he is a winner\" 'cause, for I saw in the video, doesn't seems a motivational video, if you can, watch the video I think that this will you understand better the context of video and after if you would wrong, give me the right answer, anyway thanks 🙏🙏",
      "And this doesn't make sense 'cause is as he(CR7 knows that me (or who is watching) is a winner, being that he is the winner you know?",

      ">  why \"he\" and doesn't \"you\"? \n\n...does not make sense.\n\nPerhaps you mean,\n\n> Why \"he\" and not \"you\"?\n\n...but that wouldn't make sense either, because he *is* using \"you\". So perhaps you mean,\n\n> Why is it \"you\" and not \"he\"?\n\n...and the answer to that is: because that's how the person chose to write it.\n\nIt doesn't have to make any sense.",
      "Yeah, this is it.\n\nTo be honest, I only understood what it meant after I watched the video, so I wouldn't worry too much. People only write like this in memes and TikTok-style videos, and it often won't make sense without that context.",

      "This list doesn't sound like little things to make you sound fluent. They sound like basic grammar concepts.\n\nLike, absolutely no disrespect intended, but if you're making these mistakes, you're not really approaching fluency yet and probably need more practice with basic grammar before worrying about trying to sound fluent.",

They're not always incorrect.\n\nBut yes, they are not standard English. Though \"How it looks like\" (with s) is also fairly normal in standard English, as pointed out by another comment, though technically 'wrong'.",

      "Also, not using plurals for people whose native language does not have plural forms of words. Years ago, around Easter, there was a banner in front of a local store that said “Easter Hat”.

All other pans have shallow sides and long handles, whereas all other pots have high sides and short handles.\n\nSo to recap: A saucepan is not a pan, it is a pot. Yes this is annoying.",
      "In the UK at least this seems to be individual preference, though pan seems to have become a lot commoner over time.\n\nIn the 1980s, I grew up calling both these types of object pots. However as I got older, I found that a lot of people called them pans, especially ones with handles, and over time I started saying that more frequently so I could be sure they knew what I was talking about. But I still prefer to say say pot for any relatively deep ones such as those in the picture, while pan would refer to a flat shallow one a.k.a. frying pan\n\nIt's also possible that there is some regional difference, although I've not spotted one consistently despite having lived in a lot of different parts of the UK. I'd be really interested to hear if other British people, especially middle-aged or older, have observed regional variations.",

It seems from this that some of them should be called \"pots\" and some \"pans\" but I never learnt that distinction. Although I do use specific words like \"frying pan\" or \"saucepan\".",
      "I would call both of those items “pots”.  For me, a pan has much lower sides and is meant for frying and sautéing.  A pot is deeper and is for boiling water and making sauces. Not hard and fast rules, but that’s how I use those words.",
      "Those are both pots.\n\nPots are deep and pans are shallow.\n\nA pot can be used for cooking soup or boiling water for pasta, a pan can be used for stir-fry or cooking a grilled cheese sandwich.",
      "Broadly speaking, a pan is shallower than a pot, i.e. it has a relatively wide base and short sides. The classic pan is the [frying pan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frying_pan), or skillet. Many American households will have sauté/saucier pans, braisers/braising pans, or roasting pans in the kitchen as well.\n\nDespite the name, most Americans would consider saucepans to be a pot—the inverse of a pan, where the sides are tall relative to the base. The archetypical pot is a saucepan (like the orange item in your first example) or a stock pot; dutch ovens (the blue item in your second example) are also common.",
      "They're both pots. A pan is shallow while a pot is deep. You wouldn't (generally) sear things in a pot or boil things in a pan.",

My understanding was always that anything with a long handle is a pan, anything else is a pot, but some would call both pans! It's such vague and largely interchangeable terminology in UK English that I wouldn't worry about the difference.\n\nIf for a specific reason you need to avoid confusion it's best to specify the type of pan/pot. Orange is a saucepan, blue is a casserole dish.\n\nAmerican posters are likely to refer to blue as a \"Dutch Oven\" - DO NOT USE THIS IN THE UK. We don't call anything to do with cooking this, instead in UK English it means a space where someone has been farting a lot!",

      "I have developed a very elite technique for this over many years. It goes like this:\n\nYou walk up to a person, say, \"Hi, my name's <insert name here>. What's yours?\" In business settings, as you do this, extend your right hand and give them a firm, brief, (and most importantly) dry handshake.\n\nAnd that's it. 100% success rate. The handshake can be used in some casual settings as well, but there's some nuance to that. Hope this helps.",

According to the definition of a Utopia, the Utopian system must operate in a certain way that fulfills a human being’s happiness. To do so, the system would need to track an individual’s desires and trigger events to change the environment positively at appropriate moments for the individual, which is apparently acceptable. However, thinking of a Utopia, there are lots of people who hold different ideals. It means, at least, each group of people in the same place has a different desire at the same moment. Therefore, the system must operate distinct ways that fulfill each human being’s happiness, simultaneously.

      "You’re being very wordy in your writing and repeating things multiple times. This can be rewritten much, much more concisely. Here’s an example where your entire piece can be condensed into just three or so sentences: \n\nIf a utopia is a place where all people experience continuous happiness, then a utopian society must in turn function in a way that fulfills each person’s ideals; however, each person’s ideals will differ, sometimes a little and sometimes a lot. This requires a utopian society to operate in a way that must inherently contradict itself at least sometimes. For this reason, a true utopia is not possible.\n\nMy tip for you as you rewrite would be to focus on brevity and remove the unnecessary repetition or deepen your argument so that there is more substance (if you’re doing this for an assignment and need to have a certain length).

You could recast it as \"~~There is not one good reason why utopias could exist~~\" \"There aren't any good reasons why utopias can exist\" Then you go on to list all the reasons you think aren't any good.\n\nOverall, I would define the utopia first, and then say \"But every human being has their own desires...\" and then the conclusion \"Therefore, the systems that operate....\"\n\nI don't know that this is a problem of English and grammar, as much as it is about formulating an argument in a logical order.",

      "Your writing is really wordy. You are using complicated language in circles without getting to the point. This makes your writing hard to parse. \n\nYour first paragraph could easily be “Utopias can’t exist because every human has their own desires and ideals. Humans are happy when their desires and ideals are fulfilled.” Even then it makes no sense because you don’t actually explain your initial premise. You just say they can’t exist and list other claims. \n\nAnother issue is that you constantly restate the context of everything. “Let me define a utopia” “the definition of a utopia”, “a utopian system”, “thinking of a utopia”, “in a utopia” you also restated the definition and requirements of a utopia like three times. The reader doesn’t need to be reminded of things every sentence. \n\nYou can just say “A utopia is a place of continuous happiness. Achieving this would require continuous monitoring and changing the world to fit your unique happiness. However since everyone has different desires and ideals, it’s impossible for a utopian system to make everyone in one place happy at the exact same time.”\n\nBeyond this, depending on the objective of the class or the reason for this argument I would possibly dock some points for your misunderstanding of what a utopia is. You’re writing about a really narrow concept of a utopia that you made up rather than consulting a dictionary or looking up examples. There are plenty of pieces of media describing utopias that would not meet your made up definition.",

I’m not sure of your age or grade but it’s typically something we see in more juvenile writing (although so many people still do it in college)."

I know that I've grown a lot in reading and writing skills, but recently I've really been feeling that I need to work on my accent.  \nUntil a few weeks ago, I thought my English accent was as good as natives. However, it was just that my friends \"evolved\" to understanding Korean accent, and it wasn't that my accent improved.  \nThe most embarrassing thing happened last week: I was volunteering for kids for VBS, and one kid called me and said that she couldn't understand what I'm saying well because of my accent. I didn't know my accent was THAT strong even the kid could know it.\n\nNow I know how important accent is, and I really want to improve on it.  \nBad news is that I'm already 16 and I heard that your accent won't change well if you have already passed puberty or you're at puberty right now. I'm kind of concerned about that.\n\nIf you guys have any ideas or recommendations, please comment and help me.  \nThanks for reading my long story guys.",

      "I just want to tell you, my grandfather learned English around your age and he could eventually speak English like he was a native. I don’t think I’ve ever heard him speak English with any sort of foreign accent. You’d never guess it was his second language. I think the “you can’t lose your accent after puberty” thing is a myth. You can do it!",
      "If you're comfortable, [go here](https://vocaroo.com/) and record yourself reading a sample text. Edit your post to include a link to the recording.",
      "I’ve been learning English for years, and even though my grammar and vocab are decent, my accent still gives me away sometimes. It’s kinda frustrating when people don’t understand you, especially in situations like volunteering (kids can be brutally honest lol).\n\nBut hey, don’t stress about the whole “puberty” thing too much! I’ve heard that myth too, but I know plenty of people who improved their accents way later in life. It’s more about practice and exposure than age. One thing that helped me was shadowing like, listening to native speakers (YouTube, podcasts, etc.) and trying to mimic their pronunciation and rhythm. It feels silly at first, but it actually works over time!\n\nAlso, don’t be too hard on yourself. Your friends understanding you is a good sign it means your accent isn’t that strong, just maybe not 100% native-like yet. And that’s okay!",
      "I think statistically people who learn English later in life get to a functional level and just choose not to work too hard on their accent. That gets lumped into the fact that it’s more common for 2nd language English speakers to retain accents like my grandma from Thailand who has been here for 52 years. She has improved A LOT but it’s still very rough because she only hangs around in Thai and Asian circles and doesn’t practice mindfully (or at all). I don’t think she cares to fix her accent much either because it works 90% of the time and she has “better things to do” lol \n\n It’s not so much that they “can’t” work on it. Actors go through vocal coaching and learn accents. Some learn them very well. They also speak English but there are many British actors, with heavy accents in their normal life, in American movies that I shamefully didn’t realize were British until very recently. \n\nThere’s a lot of nuance in phonology. Vowel pronunciation goes all the way down to tongue position and mouth shape and the flow of spoken sentences. English linguists can explain them very well if you find videos on American english accents.",
      "have to know what specifically you're doing wrong first. learn proper american english vowels and consonants. koreans also have an intonation and liaising issue.",
      "If you can't get a tutor, maybe try looking for some apps that can check your pronunciation, now with AI, it should be easy. And don't give up! Btw. sometimes when people don't understand you, it's about them, not you. Some people just have a problem with understanding accent, lots of Dutch people have that. And if sb is rude to you because they don't understand,well that's definitely their problem. Sending positive energy :)",

My kids find a Scottish accent pretty difficult to understand, (so much that they made a comment about it), but we would never expect a native English speaker from Scotland to adapt their accent to us. If you want to work on it, great! But I actually think that it's a great experience for kids to hear different accents and to learn to adapt their listening skills. Also, some accents are really nice and don't generally make it difficult to understand someone. I'm not trying to discourage you. I think you can do it if you're motivated and willing to put in the time. Just try not to feel insecure or to put too much pressure on yourself about it.",

      "I dare say, as someone whose first language is English and has learned a couple other languages, that accents in English matter far less than any other language. Theres such a wide gamut of accents across 'native' speakers and its such a wide spread language that I believe you really shouldn't worry about it.\n\n\nYes, its important to be understood — but in my experience in North America (typically the US Midwest), some people are just jerks who do not want to hear an accent, let alone any other language. \n\n\nPractice speaking in long form with little essays, listen to podcasts, find pain points in your grammar and pronunciation, etc. But do not worry. It is by no means a mark against your character/ability to not have a bland - native sounding accent. Diversity across English keeps it interesting. If we all spoke the Kings English, everything would be terribly boring.",

It sounds a bit formal, but it's not strange to hear it among friends when one is explaining something to another. \n\n\nThis sort of pattern, a noun... apause... and an explanation  is often used with a specific falling intonation in presentations, or explanations of processes or systems to indicate that more info is coming. \n\nFor example, a host at a boardgame party might say this as they they are placing a new board game on the table. \n\nOkay... so... how this works....   we all roll a dice and move around the board, and... blah blah blah. \n\nIt's often described in grammatical terms as a subject in apposition, where you state the same noun twice without a conjunction for a \"double\" subject.

So... where they stopped...  eastern Europe and the northern Chinese border.  \n \nThe pattern is being used to introduce new topics that require explanation.\n\nTLDR: we use this pattern with pretty extreme falling intonation to set a subject for discussion, provide more detail about a subject, or clarify why a subject is important.",

    "text": "",
    "comments": [
      "After you set the thermostat to 24 degrees, we say it is set at 24 degrees. “To” tells you where it’s going, while “at” tells you where it is now. You don’t normally set a thermostat “for” anything but you’ll be understood. \n\nYou don’t set a timer “at” a time because “at” implies a specific time, not a length of time. “For” tells us the length of time. “To” tells us a new setting. So. *At* 9:30 I set a timer *for* ten minutes. Then someone told me ten minutes wasn’t long enough, so I reset it *to* twenty minutes. Does that make sense?",
      "For the thermostat, I would say \"to\" or \"at\". For the timer, I would say \"for\".",
      "For thermostat, I’d say either to or at. For timer I’d say either to or for. ",
      "\"To\" would be my usage for the thermostat.  \"At\" would be perfectly understandable, but it's not something I would personally say.  \"For\" is the only preposition I would use for the timer.",
      "I would use “to” in the first example and “for” in the second example (although I would not find “to” unusual there).",
      "Generally, units of time or distance use 'for':  \nI set a timer for 20 minutes. We drove for 300 miles. I worked out for 30 minutes. I haven't seen him for two weeks. We're going away for a few days.\n\nMost other measurements use \"to\" or \"at\". These are largely interchangeable, though \"at\" is generally used in the past tense:  \nOur spending limit was set at £30. The bar was set at 5 meters.  \nWe're limited to 50mph in this vehicle. Set phasers to stun (not a great example this last one, but in this context 'stun' is a setting on a scale, so it is kind of a measurement).\n\nAnd sometimes, you need both in the same sentence:  \nBake in the oven *for* 30 minutes *at* 180 degrees.\n\nEdit: Just an edit to say there are specific circumstances where you would use \"at\" for a length of time, which is again if you're describing a thing that has (or had) a limit: \"The record was previously set at 1hr 45m for this race distance\", \"the time limit for this task is set at 3hrs\". In these cases, you're talking about the record or the time limit, not the actual time itself. I'm not sure how best to describe this one, other than to say every rule has exceptions. :D\n\nThere's also an example I can think of where you'd use 'to' for a period of time: \"Reset the clock to 1m 30s\".",
      "Here is how I would interpret each of them:\n\n.\n\nThermostat:\n\nTo: You adjusted the thermostat so it is now at 24 degrees (C). Standard usage.\n\nFor: You adjusted the thermostat so it is now at 24 degrees (C). Not really standard; the emphasis here is on the fact that the temperature in the house will become (or is *expected to become*) 24 degrees at some point in the near-ish future, and most likely is not 24 degrees right now.\n\nAt: When the temperature in the house (or other area with its temperature being recorded) reached 24 degrees, you set the thermostat to a temperature that might have been mentioned earlier.\n\n.\n\nTimer:\n\nTo: You set the timer such that it now reads 10 minutes. You did not necessarily start it or stop it.\n\nFor: You set the timer such that it will go off 10 minutes from now.\n\nAt: When ten minutes had passed since some event (likely mentioned previously), you set the timer to some amount (likely also mentioned previously).\n\n.\n\nTLDR: Thermostat *to*, Timer *to* or *for* depending on context.",
      "“… at 24 degrees”\n“… for 10 minutes”\n\nAn *alarm* would be set *for* a certain time, but a timer is set *for* a length of time.\n\nBut in most other cases, “set” is followed by “to” (or “on,” if you mean “set” in the sense of “placed.”). So you may hear “set to 24 degrees” or “set to 10 minutes,” and most likely no one would notice if you said either.",
      "Casually all of these are acceptable and I've heard every one of them used without even blinking at it.\n\nVery very slight differences in connotation, but I'd have a hard time explaining them all.",
      "\"I set the thermostat to 24\"\n\"The thermostat is set at 24\"\nI wouldn't use \"for\"\n\n\"I set the timer to 10 minutes\"\n\"I set the timer for 10 minutes\"\n\"The timer is set at 10 minutes\"",
      "To\n\nFor",
      "If we are going with the most technically correct answer it would be that you set the thermostat to 24 degrees and set the timer for 10 minutes. \n\nYou might hear these differently in day to day speech depending on the region. For example if it was a dial timer I might say that I set the timer to 10 minutes because I physically moved the dial to the 10 minute mark",
      "First one is both honestly but to is more common, second one depends on the specific context of the quote because I can make a scenario where all three work",
      "...at 24 degrees Cesius\n\n...for 10 minutes.\n\nI do think \"set to\" would also be okay in normal conversation but strictly speaking \"at\" is used when listing a precise value and \"for\" is typical for a time period vs \"to\" is more common with like a physical position (e.g. on/off, angle degrees, etc). But since historically, both of these used to be physical, analogue devices that had marked positions for the value you wanted, \"to\" does work here.",

The last thing is that “pizza” is pronounced PEET-suh /ˈpitsə/, not PEE-zuh /ˈpizə/ despite how it’s spelled.",
      "Good pronunciation overall!\n\nOn \"ultra\", make sure you make the initial \"uhll\" sound clearly. Really thrust the tongue against the back of the top teeth to make it more pronounced. \n\nAlso, the \"r\" sound could be stronger on words like \"are\" and \"offer\". That would help the listener really hear where each word ends and begins. \n\nGreat job though, and best of luck improving!",
      "Your 'er' sounds and 'ah' sounds are over emphasised , a lot of this might have to do with morphemes in words. For example, in the word government, there is a free morpheme and a bound morpheme. \n\nGovern (free - its own word)\nMent (bound - it's a suffix) \n\nSo instead of pronouncing it in a syllabic way (eg, GOV Ern ment), try pronouncing it with the morphemes in mind (govern - ment)",
      "Hot dogs should have a shorter O\nPut a T just at the beginning of the z in pizza - \"peet-za\" (very soft T, almost just a glottal stop)\nThe only word i actually had a hard time making out was \"governments\" but that could be the recording. \nAlso, TH sound (specifically at the end of the word \"health\") - put the tip of your tongue on the tip of your top teeth and blow air through your mouth, that's the sound. \nOtherwise, your English is great! My suggestion for improving pronunciation long term would be to form a playlist of like 50-100 songs and listen to them on repeat until you know them by heart. Did this to improve my pronunciation in Swedish and I sound almost native (this from natives who've asked me where I'm from and were surprised when I said the US, they thought I was going to say somewhere in Sweden!)",

I’m also a professional writer, I have a minor in linguistics, all that fancy shit.\n\nThe problem is that, as a native speaker, it is hard for me to recommend the “right” app for you, because depending on what language system you grew up speaking, you will need a curriculum tailored to the language system you’re coming from. For example, I wouldn’t teach English to a Chinese speaker the same way I’d teach it to, say, a German, French, or even Hungarian speaker. (Hungarian is a LITTLE weird in terms of language structure, but it’s still fairly aligned with western linguistic structure and syntax, at least more so than, say, Mandarin.)\n\nI DO like Duolingo, if we’re looking for purely free apps. I’ve never tried to evaluate the English courses, but I’ve got that on my backlist of things to do. Duolingo has some very specific mandates; It teaches you basic conversation conventions. It teaches you how to wait tables or sell stuff, should you ever move to your dream country before becoming fluent. It really does a great job at teaching the fundamentals of a language. I’d duo no matter what other learning tools you’re also using. Supplementally, it’s brilliant.And the way it hammers new information into your head is also very well done. I recommend duo as long as you don’t fall too in love to consider other options alongside Duo. Duo, by itself, isn’t a language learning tool, but it’s great for practicing the words and phrases you might learn out there in the world. Duo can easily get you to a conversational mastery, if you’re really willing to work.",

I speak English natively, and I’m a professional writer. I have a minor in Linguistics.

I do not expect someone to learn at a specific pace, but rather, we figure out your learning style and I tailor your lessons to how you learn best. There is never a failure in my lessons.\n\nBut I will have some questions for you:\n\n1. You say you have an urgent need to learn. How SOON (how FAST) would you like to improve your language skills?\n2. What are your GOALS for improving your English? (some people want to move to an English speaking region to work, some want to study, others want to meet a love interest, etc.)\n3. What is/are your NATIVE LANGUAGE(S)/fluent language(s) now? This will help me figure out how to best approach teaching English. I will approach teaching differently depending on what language system you’re starting from. Example: I will introduce English to a native Chinese speaker in a different way than I would introduce English to a native German speaker, just as one example.\n4. If any of these questions don’t make sense, please ASK ME TO EXPLAIN ANYTHING, and I will do so. If I can explain anything in a way you can understand and feel comfortable with, then I might be a good teacher for you.\n\nI DO have to charge, as this is part of my job, but I can be flexible.

It's not easy to feel a wide arrangement of emotions, to be friendly, to carry burdens, to keep going, to be stressed, sad or exhausted. You wouldn't want to be a cat either if you're still human, because that would mean that despite being a cat, you would still have human emotions and worries.\n\n\nThat's more a philosophical approach, though. But I still think that it's good to know that, based on context, a slight difference can be made between \"human\" and \"a human\"",

I also try light shadowing, even though I struggle to speak clearly.\n\nI speak Tagalog and Kapampangan (though not fluently all the time). Does already knowing two languages mean I have a better chance of acquiring English more easily?\n\nRight now, I think I’m around A2 or B1 level. I’d really appreciate any advice, tips, or personal stories from those who have been through a similar experience. Thank you so much!",

That's the least demand of an interview. Afterward? come on, native speakers can always understand what you are saying.",
      "What you are asking doesn't really have an answer. No two learners are the same. And no learner is the same across all their languages.  Some learners say they love services like FluentU. It all depends on your individual learning style and various strengths and skills. Try a bit of everything and try not to become dependent on AI and get into the habit of producing authentic language yourself. Do not be afraid of making errors. Errors are actually the little gifts that are opportunities and invitations to focus your knowledge and skills. Good luck.",
      "Hey there! I totally get where you're coming from, I’ve been grinding with English for a while too, and sometimes it feels like progress is super slow. 😅 But trust me, it does click eventually! For me, it was a mix of input (like you’re doing) plus finally forcing myself to speak, even if it was just talking to myself or recording voice notes.\n\nSince you’re aiming for customer service, maybe try practicing common phrases or scenarios out loud? Like, pretend you’re helping a customer with a problem. It feels silly at first, but it helps a ton with fluency. Also, shadowing is great! Even if it’s hard now, your pronunciation will improve if you keep at it.\n\nAbout knowing multiple languages - yes, it probably helps! Your brain’s already used to switching between languages, so English might come easier once you get enough exposure.",
      "You're already doing an amazing job with consistent input and self-study. It really does click eventually, often when you least expect it. Many learners find that once listening becomes comfortable, speaking starts to follow naturally with time and repetition. Knowing multiple languages can definitely help.

      "Does she actually read the words? Probably not. But a lot of kids memorize the names and connect them to the shape of the dinosaur (i.e. they learn to speak the name and recognize the dinosaur).\n\nIn some exceptional cases where the parents have been drilling the child? Sure. The spelling-pronunciation of dinosaur names is actually fairly regular, since they’re transliterations of Greek and Latin roots. But it’s probably not as valuable a skill as reading simple books would be (that can be expanded and generalized later on).",
      "The vast majority of 2-year-olds can't read so I'm going to say no, they can't read the names of those dinosaurs either.",

      "Almost no 2 year olds can read, so no. But many kids are super into dinosaurs and can remember dozens of dinosaur names.",
      "I have a granddaughter who is 2.5yo. I have this same 'book' or one very similar - the pictures are vinyl and they peel off and you can put them on a larger 'scene'. (I'm 54 - for anyone in the US who's older, it's basically just cheap colorforms.)\n\nAnyway - my granddaughter can name probably 1/2 of these. She doesn't read at all. She memorizes the names, mainly from cartoon shows that mention them. She loves dinosaurs, so we watch a lot of cartoons about dinosaurs, and they often say, \"there's a tyrannisauris rex!\" so she knows the flying one is the t-rex. Zero reading - just memorizing/remembering at this point - at least for us!",
      "Little kids that are into dinosaurs know a lot of the names. Adults who are not into dinosaurs may only know tyrannosaurus. (If you watch a little bit of the popular kids’ show Dinosaur Train, you will hear most of these names.)

      "No, they can't read them, but yes, they can learn them. Never underestimate the power of a small child's love for dinosaurs. 😂",
      "What 2-year-old is even able to read anything at all?\n\nI don't even know more than half of these dinosaur names as an adult. I remember learning about brontosaurus, stegosaurus and maybe one or two others in school when I was about 8.",
      "the words literally mean “long-necked dinosaur,” “three horned dinosaur,” “sword dinosaur,” “ancestor bird,” “king dinosaur,” “steal egg dinosaur,” etc. They just mean it in Latin. like oviraptor is literally ovi- (egg) + -raptor (thief). They’re not any more complicated than they would be in your native language, at least not if your kid gets taught prefixes and suffixes, although those are usually taught around 4th grade (~ age 8-9)",
      "Does the 2 year old read those words? Probably not. \n\nIt's probably a book that he reads to his kid. I've been reading to my son since he was 3 months old. \n\nThat said, my son was *really* into dinosaurs and could read and remember tons of dinosaur names by the time he was 4. So it's not necessarily that weird for a little kid to know big words for something they're really interested in. And even if they can't read the letters, they may know the name of the dinosaur and be able to recognize it.",

The words are a bonus for older kids and maybe even adults.",
      "The vast majority of 2yos can't read at all, so this little girl probably wasn't reading the words. I could believe that she'd memorised them though, assuming her dad had been reading the names for her and she has connected them to the shapes. At that age, my niece didn't know dinosaur names but she knew some other words you might not have expected her to, just because that's what she was interested in. \n\nI know how to spell the names of the dinosaurs I hear about most often - velociraptor, tyrannosaurus rex, triceratops, pterodactyl, etc. - but probably couldn't even name a lot of the less common ones.

    "text": "Guys, I'm currently learning English and I can't understand the difference between discouraging and disheartening. Plssss help 🥲\nThank you all!!! ",
    "comments": [
      "Here’s how I see it:\n\n* **Discouraging** is when something makes you lose motivation or confidence to keep trying. Like if you fail a test and it makes you wanna give up, that’s discouraging.\n* **Disheartening** is more about feeling sad or hopeless because of something. Like if you put a lot of effort into a project and it still fails, it’s not just discouraging (making you not wanna try again), but also disheartening (makes you feel really down).\n\nA little trick: think of \"disheartening\" as hitting your heart (emotions), while \"discouraging\" hits your will to keep going.",
      "They're pretty much synonyms; discourage is a little more flexible in its use, for example one use is \"to try to dissuade/prevent something,\" whereas dishearten is used mainly only one way. Examples on Merriam-Webster: [discourage](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/discourage) and [dishearten](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/dishearten).",
      "Both come from the same root word. The cour- comes from *cor* meaning \"heart\" in Latin. \n\n\nDiscouraging refers to something that is probably going to turn out poorly, but hasn't yet. \n\n\n*With a discouraging score of 5-0, the team started doubting their prospects.*\n\n\nDisheartening refers to something that has turned out poorly.\n\n\n*The locker room was silent as the team grieved their disheartening loss.*",
      "They have slightly different connotations but they're pretty much entirely interchangeable. I can't think of a single example where it is appropriate to use one but not the other.\n\nTo take (or have) heart basically means to have courage.",
      "Disheartening rarely gets used. Both words share essentially the same meaning, but disheartening might feel a little deeper. Something discouraging feels to me like something temporary. Something that is disheartening feels more heartfelt and thorough.",
      "Feeling Disheartened is to lack motivation because things aren’t going to plan or something bad/sad has happened. \n\nDiscourage is more like trying to persuade someone not to do something (the opposite of encouraging), although you can also feel discouraged, which could, I suppose be similar to disheartened.",
      "Part of language is interpretation, so here would be my mine:\n\nDiscouraging - root = lack of courage, bravery. Used when something sets you back or hinders working toward a goal. For example: it is discouraging to see that I haven’t made any progress in my book report.\n\nDisheartening - root = lack of/losing heart. Being disheartened feels much more like a… feeling, if that makes sense. For example: it disheartening to see that most children are addicted to social media.",
      "you have google on your cellphone?",
      "Great explanation.",

It’s an extra resource just for Discord members, which is pretty cool.",
      "I don’t fully disagree about connotations here, but if you switched discouraged and disheartened in these two example sentences, both sentences would still be fully correct and sound natural. Despite slight connotation differences, these words are largely interchangeable, with the one caveat that peekandlumpkin points out below.",
      "Pretty sure the whole point of this sub is to get real answers from real English speakers?",
      "obviously yes  but in case you need a quicker responce while you are waiting for folks here to jump in, you may refer to google. that was my point",

    "title": "The usage of the verb \"spam\"",
    "text": "Hello. I'm learning English and became curious about the correct use of the verb 'spam.' It seems like a slang term for sending spam emails (literally) or pressing buttons many times quickly.\n\nHowever, can it also mean to 'place/build something all around'? For example, can I say, \"You don't want to spam parking lots all around the city unless you want to create an urban hell?\"",
    "comments": [
      "Both usages are come ultimately from a Monty Python sketch. Spam is a processed meat product, and in the sketch, someone goes into a cafe and discovers it \\~only\\~ serves Spam, in various preparations. The sketch ends with them singing a song, the only word of which is \"spam\".\n\nMonty Python was extremely popular with nerds, and nerds were the people deciding what to call a lot of computer terms, which have since become incredibly important to culture more widely. Spam email sends everyone the same thing, much like the cafe will serve everyone spam. \n\nSpam email is so prevelent, and the term for it so widely known, that \"spam\" become a common term for when something's the first and last thought. So in your example, you've got some urban space? Just put down a parking lot. No need to think more about it, parking lots are cheap and make money. You are serving everyone the same thing.",
      "Technically, your second example is okay and understandable. \n\nGenerally, I (I'm not going to include all native speakers) use spam with digital things such as messages, ads, and links. And sometimes this can go into the physical world, such as \"spam the city with billboards,\" or \"spam your desktop with shortcuts\", or \"They’ve spammed the city with neon signs\". However, in the physical aspect, it is more related to advertising.",
      "Yeah, \"spam\" is mostly used for sending unwanted messages or clicking stuff repeatedly (like \"stop spamming me with texts!\" or \"he spammed the jump button in the game\").\n\nYour example about parking lots is creative! It’s not super common to use it that way, but honestly, in casual talk or online, people might get what you mean especially if it’s exaggerated or ironic. I’ve seen gamers say stuff like \"he spammed buildings everywhere\" in RTS games, so it’s not totally unheard of.",
      "In your second example, it doesn't mean \"place/build something,\" instead it's a metaphor that is comparing \"placing parking lots\" to sending spam emails (as in: haphazardly, without thought or regard for decency).",
      "The second example is a good way to use it. And I very much agree with it as well 🤣",
      "You can use it to mean 'doing something repeatedly', but as other people said, it's usually used in a digital context. You *can* use it in a non-digital context, but it'll just sound a bit funnier, like you're trying to be humorous for the most part.",
      "Other people have explained it well, but I’ll add that the uses “pressing buttons many times” and “filling an area with a million copies of the same thing” are primarily used by people online and by young people who are very engaged with the internet; they haven’t fully made it into mainstream English. Most young people would know what you meant, and some middle-aged people would be able to figure it out, but it’s not something older people would know, and it’s casual speech.",
      "I would definitely understand your second usage and I would assume that you had picked it up from watching Minecraft videos.",
      "\"the only word of which is \"spam\".\" - Not quite true. It also has words like \"glorious\", \"wonderful\" to describe the spam! But 99% is indeed spam.  \nOn a more serious note, I wouldn't personally understand spam as the only thing in the modern sense. It seems to me, spam is about something being a) too much and b) unwanted. Possibly also c) untargeted. That still makes the sentence from the OP perfectly fine, but might change the perceived meaning for some.",
      "[The sketch in question.](https://youtu.be/anwy2MPT5RE?si=4qv_MV1tauPPklMR)\n\nThe usage started when someone made the observation that their email inbox was like the menu items in the sketch - “spam, spam, spam, spam, real email, spam, spam, real email, and spam.”",
      "Also to add, the context of Spam at that time was that meat (and other goods) were rationed in the UK from the start of WWII in 1939 until 9 years post-war, in 1954.  So those guys grew up having to eat crappy spam instead of beef or other good meat.  And so for them, Spam was something that was abundant and low quality.",
      "That makes sense. Thank you for the detailed explanation!",
      "Thanks! I was actually thinking about city-building video games, where you can easily end up making a mess of parking lots all around",

      "Amazing movie by the way!",
      "Locations in Manhattan, New York City can be thought of as \"up\" (roughly north) or \"down\" (roughly south) hence terms like \"downtown\" or \"uptown.\" As a New Yorker we think of places as being \"up\" or \"down\" in this way; it's not really an English thing but a NYC thing.",
      "This could be contextual to the region. Where I live in the Pacific Northwest, “up” is usually north along the I-5 corridor, and south is “down.” We might also say “I’m going over to [a city to the east or west]” or sometimes “I’m going *out* to [a city to the east or west].”",
      "\"Down\" is used colloquially in a lot of regional dialects to describe 'south of or below where you usually are'.\n\nIf you're from New York and you're visiting Atlanta (geographically south), people might ask \"what brings you all the way down here?\". They're just asking what caused you to travel so far south of where you normally live.\n\nSometimes it means underneath. If you go \"down to the basement\", you're traveling in a downwards direction.\n\nSometimes this is used in situations where to a non-native speaker it probably doesn't make sense. In my village for instance, most of the houses are around the top of the village, so whenever we're going anywhere, we say we're going \"down the road\", \"down \\[to\\] the pub\", \"down to the shops\", because almost everything is downhill from our houses.

If I heard someone say, \"my flight was 4 hours\" I'm not going to think, *\"they didn't say* only\\*, so it could possibly be more...\\*.\"  But certainly one could say, \"My flight was only 4 hours.\"\n\nIf I read a statement, \"The Boeing 947 can fly 12 hours\", I'm 100% assuming that the 12 hours is some sort of an upper limit.  That's just how we infer meaning.\n\nSo I'd say A) is wrong according to the rules of communication.  The article never says \"The plane can fly \\_\\_\\_\\_ hours\", as if you're getting an upper limit... and that's how it would be understood by any native/proficient speaker.\n\n(edit first sentence to say \"not technically true in the conventional sense\")"

      "Modal verbs. Ugh. \n\n\nBoth \"must\" and \"have to\" are correct.  \n\n\nHowever, \"must\" could be considered more formal (think something written as a rule/policy) and \"have to\" is informal. \n\n\nI'm a native speaker, and I'd have chosen \"must\" as well. \n\n\nThis may help with modal verbs. \n\n\nhttps://learnenglishteens.britishcouncil.org/grammar/a1-a2-grammar/have-must-should-obligation-advice",
      "A and B should both be correct, they mean virutally the same thing. Usually you can pick up on some slight minor detail that changes the meaning, but those two are synonyms in every single sense. For what it's worth, I would have chosen B as well.",
      "Must is the correct answer. You want the formal imperative here. \n\nHave to is technically acceptable, but it’s informal. This is a formally written document stating a requirement. \n\nShould is not imperative. This is a requirement, not a suggestion.",
      "Poor question/answer setup, imo, as both a and b work. c comes close, and most would understand it, but 'should' implies optionality, which is already inferred by giving a consequence for not, meaning a should here would project a scenario where you don't show your passport but can still board, and is technically incorrect.",
      "Is it giving instructions to passengers, or is it just describing what happens at an airport? First case I’d say must, second case I’d say have to.",
      "Shit like this makes me feel bad for you non-native speakers, one of these is slightly more formal than the others, but trust me, we dont care, we will know what you mean, and there are so many ways to get across any given thought in this language itll make your head spin and i think questions like this can be discouraging, because English is apparently a very difficult language to learn. We speak English because its the only language we know. You guys learn English because its the only language we know lol. Obviously from the US here.",
      "Unrelated, but the clause structure is a bit off here. Otherwise is not a conjunction—it's a conjunctive adverb. This means you can't connect the clauses with a comma; you have to use a semicolon, with a comma after the adverb.\n\n**Incorrect**: Passengers must show a valid passport before boarding the plane, otherwise they will not be able to travel.\n\n**Correct:** Passengers must show a valid passport before boarding the plane; otherwise, they will not be able to travel.",
      "\"Have to\" and \"must\" both are fine. \"Have to\" sounds more conversational while \"must\" sounds formal, like how it might be written into regulations.\n\n\"Should\" could be used as a way to really soften it, making it sound like a suggestion when the sentence is actually stating what must happen. However, the fact that I clarified that with \"must\" shows the difference. \"Should\" implies there might be other options and would never be said in regards to something as highly regulated as air travel.",
      "The standard thing that is taught about the difference between must and have to is that must is internal and have to is external. For example, if I say \"I must finish this essay today\", that could be because I have other work to do tomorrow, even though the deadline is the day after. In that case, \"I have to finish this essay by the day after tomorrow\" would indicate that the university requires it by then. I assume the correct answer will be given as A for this reason. In this particular instance, I think they are virtually interchangeable in normal usage, so it is just not a great question.",
      "Not only is it right, but in situations like this, where it's a formal setting with an official rule, it's very common.",
      "Comma splice!",
      "Is it “Have to show” and “Must display”? I suppose “Must show” does sound a little funky, but I think it’s unfair to call it incorrect. Any native speaker might choose ‘Must’ here",
      "To give you the ‘grammar book’ answer:\n\nUse ‘have to’ to express an external obligation - something that is necessary as a rule or law, imposed on everyone as a rule set down by an external authority.  \n\nUse ‘must’ to express a personal obligation, or when you give / assign someone an obligation.",
      "As others have said, all of them sound fine. Not a great question.\n\nThat being said, let me make a guess. This kind of construct could be used in two ways:\n\n* Passengers \"must\". If they don't, something bad will happen, and since they'd never want that, they \"must\" follow.\n* Passengers \"are asked to\" do this. If they don't, what will happen is (blah blah). It's not like 'end of the world' serious MUST thing.\n\nThe options \"must\" and \"have to\" fit in each case. \"should\" sounds like somewhere in between, and I also feel this very slight notion of imposing a moral or spontaneous obligation. IMO the passport thing feels like a \"must\".\n\nAgain, this is not a definitive answer or anything. I might be wrong as well.",
      "All three answers sound fine to me"

      "\"Abroad\" is an adverb in the phrase \"be abroad.\" The way they are being is abroad.\n\nAdjectives modifies nouns, whereas adverbs modify verbs and adjectives. So in both cases, *\"to be*\" is the verb that is modified, making it an adverb.\n\nIt's similar to \"about\" when that word is used as an adverb in phrases like\n\n\"There were many people about.\"\n\nThe way you know it's not an adjective is that you can't really say \"look at all those abroad people.\"",
      "It absolutely is used as an [adjective](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/abroad).",

      "*Abroad* is both an adverb and adjective.\n\nThe fact that we can't say \"those abroad people\" doesn't mean that *abroad* is not an adjective. Adjectives that begin with the a- prefix are not used prepositively, i.e. before the noun they modify. We couldn't use words like *alive*, *asleep*, *awake*, *alone* in that place either, but those are all clearly adjectives.\n\n*Abroad* when used with *be* is an adjective. We can say \"I am abroad\" the same way we can say \"I am awake\".",
      "Ooh, so it really is a nuance. That similarity to \"about\" cleared this confusion for me hehe. It's just weird, because it could easily just have a proper definition as a pure adjective, if only its adverb form is *abroad****ly****.*",

      "\"I am abroad\" isn't using it as an adjective, as per the OP.

      "Your accent sounds good to me. A native English speaker would be able to tell that your first language is French, but you aren’t difficult to understand. If someone isn’t expecting to hear an accent, sometimes it can take the brain a second to adjust, but once they do, it should be fine.  \n  \nI don’t think a perfect accent is important. As long as people can understand you, that’s all that matters. If anything, in the U.S. people might like your accent. Outside of large cities, most Americans don’t get to meet that many French people.",
      "Each language/ accent has a phonology (list of sounds) that speakers of that language can say in any word,  as they are a part of the language's inventory. I would look into the phonology of your French accent,  and the accent you want to emulate (General American) and determine which sounds are in General American that aren't in you native language.  These are the sounds you'll need to learn to approximate with a similar sound or learn how to pronounce them. For example, French doesn't have the voiceless glottal fricative (h) and is a sound that can be hard to replicate. Look into the actual mouth mechanics of creating the sounds and try to practice creating them and using them in some English words.",
      ">\"I'm kind of scared to have people not understanding what I'm saying, which happens often.\" \n\nnative English speakers are also used to people with different accents being hard to understand and working around that. we might ask you to repeat yourself or say it a different way, but don't be afraid or nervous to encounter this. it even happens to native English speakers when we go to other English speaking countries with different accents. \n\nyour speech sounds totally fine to me. I can understand everything you say.",
      "As a British person, I'm not getting American - just French. As others have said, your accent is perfectly understandable to me. And... I'm not sure how universal this is, but I think that the French accent is generally regarded as sounding lovely! You're absolutely fine as you are. Genuinely, if people ask you to repeat something, it might be because it sounds so good - I've encountered this with more than one French friend :-)",
      "First, I don't think many Americans would have difficulty understanding you as you speak right now. You have a few issues with vowels (which I can understand; French is very consistent with phonics). For instance, you say \"accent\" like \"ay-sent\", when it needs a hard 'k' sound (\"ak-sent\", think German).\n\nSecond, if you want to learn a particular accent, this is what I recommend. It's what I do when I try to learn accents (a thing I do for fun). Find a recording of someone speaking in your desired accent. Record yourself saying the exact same thing. Listen back, and compare. Identify just one or two ways you didn't quite match the recording. Try again, with those changes in mind. Repeat until you get it.\n\nSome accents come very naturally, based on exposure, and others take more work. For instance, if you're French, you may find it easier to copy accents from the UK, if you happen to have encountered a lot of Brits and British media in your life.",
      "I doubt any native speaker would have trouble understanding you. \n\nA common French accent stereotype which you do is pronouncing the short “a” as an “eh” sound. So when you say “accents” it sounds like “excents” and “have” sounds like “hev”. That was really the only thing that might affect comprehension. You could try to practice the short a sound in words like \n\nBat, hat, pat, that, accent, have. Pay attention to how Americans say these words vs bet, pet, get, and except.",

I have a different deck for the complete conjugations in all common tenses for the very irregular verbs. \n\nAlso, for nouns I put an article in front of the word, both as a reminder that I’m dealing with a noun and (for Spanish) learning the gender.

I started by enjoying them in my native language, but then I decided to switch to English. Initially, it was a struggle; a ten-page manga chapter could take me ten minutes to read. Yet, with consistent practice, I gradually improved.

I often forget words, and my grammar is consistently poor.\n\nI'm looking for recommendations for English learning apps that can identify my specific weaknesses, provide targeted tutorials, and offer relevant exercises to help me overcome these issues.\n",

      "If you're looking for something more tailored, try [Preply](https://preply.com/). You get to talk to a real tutor who can help with exactly what you're stuck on, like grammar or technical English. Way more helpful than just guessing with apps. :))",
      "My best apps are HelloTalk, Praktika, and Duolingo!\n\nDuolingo just makes me motivated.\n\nPraktika is the best speaking app I ever tried.\n\nHelloTalk is to make friends around the world!",
      "No need to worry on how to improve by yourself, try this Preply platform. There are many available professional teachers who you can ask help from anywhere in the world. You can learn speaking, reading, writing, whatever is your goal! I tried this myself and I've been learning for almost 3 years now. Nothing can beat the guidance from professionals, because I admit it's hard to learn by ourselves. What's so great is that you can choose who your tutor would be and can jump from one tutor to another.

      "Hey, I really relate to your post — especially the part about losing fluency after stepping away from regular exposure. I’m actually building an app for this exact kind of problem.  \nI recently launched the first version of YouNative, a YouTube-based app for English learners — but the bigger vision goes beyond just video playback.\n\nThe core idea I’m working on is to analyze every user’s personal “comprehension index” — to understand what kinds of sentences or videos are too easy, too hard, or just right. At the same time, I’m using AI to evaluate the difficulty level of any video or subtitle — so that the app can match each learner with content that fits them *perfectly*.\n\nIn other words: instead of throwing random content at you, the goal is to find that sweet spot where you’re challenged, but not overwhelmed.\n\nIt’s still early, and I’d love to hear from people like you — your post literally describes the exact use case I’m designing for.",
      "my English also got rusty after I stopped using it daily 😅 Your anime/manga learning method sounds awesome though! I did something similar with video games and YouTube, and it really helped my listening skills.\n\nFor apps that target weaknesses, I’ve had good luck with **Elsa Speak** (great for pronunciation gaps) and **Grammarly** (catches my grammar mistakes and explains them). **Quizlet** is also underrated, you can make custom flashcards for words you forget often.",
      "Hey, I hear ya on the English learning journey\n\ntbh building fluency is tough like it's not just about knowing words and Tubeshad tackles this head on\n\nfwiw it gives you AI powered shadowing plus real time feedback so you can nail pronunciation and get comfy with conversations\n\nI built it cause I kept running into similar walls myself and wanted a way to shortcut the awkwardness\n\nhope this helpes and gl!",
      "First off, your journey is really inspiring, switching to English manga and anime was a brilliant move, and it clearly paid off. It’s totally normal for skills to decline when we stop regular exposure, especially with language.\n\nIf your main challenge now is vocabulary loss and grammar issues during technical discussions, I’d recommend checking out **Mem-App (**[**https://mem-app.com**](https://mem-app.com)**)**. I actually built it myself because I had the same issue, remembering the *right* words at the *right* time, especially when writing or speaking professionally.\n\nMem-App is designed to help you expand and retain vocabulary, not just through definitions, but also through real usage examples, synonyms, opposites, and native pronunciation (US and UK). You can save words into your own list and review them using flashcards powered by spaced repetition, so they actually stick.\n\nIt’s not a grammar-focused app, but it works best alongside your real-world content, like technical articles, podcasts, or even documentation, by helping you build a strong, personalized vocabulary base. You can use it on your phone or desktop, and it syncs across devices when you sign in.\n\nIt’s free to try for up to 50 words, no ads, and super fast to use. If your main barrier is word recall and communication fluency, it might be exactly what you’re looking for.\n\nWishing you the best with your job search and language goals!",
      "Thank you so much",
      "Thank you so much for sharing",

    "comments": [
      "Depends on the level of the essay you’re reading and what kinds of novel, but to me in general I find essays usually harder to read than novels.",
      "Yes essays are usually harder to read  They are often dry, and dense, and hard to follow if they're not about a subject you're passionate about.\n\nI would recommend finding an author with a simple, relatively casual style. And I would stick to non-fantasy stories with a modern setting. That way you won't get bogged down with made-up names Authors like Stephen King or Michael Crichton.",
      "I think essays are harder because they’re more dense and the ideas are abstract, while fiction has a story to follow, so it’s easier to guess meanings from context. One thing that helped me was picking essays on topics I already cared about (like language learning or travel). That way, even if the vocab was tough, I was motivated to push through. Maybe try that?",
      "Perhaps try reading magazine articles.  All kinds of magazines, literary, scientific, fashion, sport, are available online, in the library or in shops.  You'll learn a lot of vocabulary and grammar, and follow an argument through much more easily than in an essay.",
      "Both fiction and essays vary quite a bit in how hard they can be to understand. Some essays are very conversational, as if the writer is talking to you friend-to-friend. Others are more scholarly and erudite.\n\nI *think* I would say that, in my experience, when I've read essays and fiction *by the same person*, I've found the essays slightly easier to understand *on the average* than the fiction. But I'm not at all sure about that,",
      "I agree with the others here - essays are usually more formal, where novels are conversational. However, this often depends on the author - a good essay writer can be an excellent teacher! If you're looking for essays, I'd suggest Isaac Asimov - he's incredibly intelligent and has a magnificent vocabulary, but his actual writings are very conversational. He had a PhD in biochemistry, but is known today for his work in science fiction. He wrote a lot of essays for a science fiction magazine, talking about actual science in a very accessible way. He died in the 1990s, so his works are not exactly cutting-edge, but I've found there's always something to be gained from reading them.\n\nHere's one collection of essays, although there are many more:\n\n[https://archive.org/details/66EssaysOnThePastPresentAndFuture/page/n13/mode/2up](https://archive.org/details/66EssaysOnThePastPresentAndFuture/page/n13/mode/2up)\n\nGood luck!",
      "In addition to what others have said: essays frequently use vocabulary that just isn't used as often, so you may be less familiar with it",
      "It depends.\n\nSome are easy, some hard.\n\nSame as books.",
      "I found a modern urban novel, the plot is not so tight, it is easier to read than essays. I feel that reading essays requires a certain language foundation.",

    "text": "",
    "comments": [
      "What do you mean by a normal book?",
      "Novels are a type of normal books. Possibly the most common kind of book - since so much fiction in so many different genres is published as novels. Science fiction novels. Romance novels. Detective novels. And so on.\n\nThey aren't inherently harder than other books - they vary about as much as any other type of book. The point of a novel is that it's one long story and it gives a lot of reading time with (usually) a lot of repeating vocabulary. It exposes you to the same words over and over again so it can be easier to retain what you learn.\n\nI'm not sure what you mean by \"normal books\". Short story collections? Non-fiction? Poetry? I think whatever interests you is going to be the best choice. Reading novels if they aren't fun for you won't get you nearly as far as reading a book about history if you do enjoy that.\n\nI think everyone's advice is to \\*read\\* - novels just happen to be common and come in a lot of varieties. If you like ghost stories in your native language, you will likely enjoy books about ghosts in English, too. So reading is more likely to be fun and not just a chore. But the advice to \\*just read\\* works just as well if you don't like fiction at all and would rather read books about economics.",
      "So I think I understand what you are saying but first off, a novel IS a normal book. Maybe you’re talking about fiction vs nonfiction. \n\nSecond I’ve experienced this a bit in my own language studies with another language. It’s hard to follow a story that is more fantasy/sci fi/magical, etc. because there are a lot of words that are made up and the whole thing may or may not be easy to pick up. There might be nuances or references in the made up concepts that a language learner might not understand. \n\nThat being said, I don’t think the divide is between fiction and nonfiction but between books more grounded in reality vs more fantastical books. \n\nI wouldn’t start a person out on reading something like Eragon or The Mistborn Trilogy to learn English because there are too many made up concepts and words. A better place to start would be a slice of life book, a romance novel set in modern times, a realistic drama book, etc. because there’s less made up fluff compared to real world language.",
      "Most books *are* novels.",
      "do you mean non-fiction when you say 'normal book'?",
      "novels = books",
      "Novels use a wider vocabulary - especially if you are reading classic literature.\n\n One of the reasons novels are recommended to learners is to help widen their vocabulary, as well as because many people like reading fiction and it's assumed that the story narrative will help sustain their attention for longer when they are improving their reading duration in the target language\n\nNon-fiction uses vocab that many learners will already be used to from newspaper articles and from material studied with a view to exams like IELTS. Therefore it probably will seem easier, especially if it's about topics you're interested in and have already consumed quite a lot of shorter content about.",
      "I guess you tried to say nonfiction as a normal book. I granted that nonfiction does feel like an easy stuff than fiction because there are no literary devices such as simile, metaphor, symbol, irony, etc. it just conveys facts with straightforward descriptions.",

It’s also used more as an adjective than a noun.\n\nDoofus is used more lightheartedly and can mean someone lacking in intelligence, someone who’s silly, and/or someone who messes around. It is used more often as a noun than an adjective\n\nFor example,\n\n“Stop being stupid.” - condescending and used as a descriptor\n\n“Stop being a doofus.” - light hearted, may be used between friends and is used as a noun\n\nStupid is a more common word than doofus, at least we’re I’m from. Doofus is rarely used as a genuine insult, and if it is the person using it would likely come off as more ‘embarrassing’ than the person it was directed at.",
      "stupid is an adjective whereas doofus is a noun - so you could say ‘that person is stupid’ and ‘that person is a doofus’, but not ‘that person is a stupid’ or ‘they’re doofus’\n\nDoofus, I would say, is more limited in use. Stupid is universal, but doofus is more North American. Though it would be understood by other English speakers, it would sound strange in British English, for example, unless being used to mimic an exaggerated American accent",
      "Stupid is an adjective*, doofus is a noun. Doofus is also a lot more informal and childish. Not that there's really an adult way to shame someone for their intelligence, but if someone older than 14 called me a doofus I would be kinda surprised.\n\n*if someone said \"you stupid\", I would assume they decided not to continue the sentence. Sometimes it's used as a noun itself, but it's not strictly proper.",
      "doofus is a noun - you're a doofus.\n\nstupid is an adjective - you're stupid.\n\ndoofus works more as a playful insult, not a scathing one.",
      "Great question! Both \"stupid\" and \"doofus\" refer to a lack of intelligence, but they have different tones.\n\n**\"Stupid\"** is a more direct and harsh word. It can be used to describe someone who is making unwise choices or lacks understanding.  \n**Example:** \"That was a stupid mistake.\"\n\n**\"Doofus,\"** on the other hand, is a more playful and light-hearted term. It often implies clumsiness or silliness rather than serious intelligence issues.  \n**Example:** \"He's such a doofus for forgetting his keys again!\"\n\nAs for making sentences, here are a few ways to use both words:\n\n1. \"I felt stupid for tripping over a doofus who was lying on the floor.\"\n2. \"Don't be a doofus; that was a stupid thing to say!\"\n\nFeel free to ask more questions!",
      "\"Stupid\" is insulting. It means you have low intelligence. It's a permanent trait. You lack the ability to make smart decisions or choose wise courses of action. \n\n\"Doofus\" can be insulting, and can mean that you have low intelligence, but it's also kind of silly. Like, you might just be dumb *in this particular instance*, or you might have a tendency to do things before you've really thought them through (but you're smart enough to do better when you take the time to think). But you're not categorically, permanently.... well, you're not *stupid.* It can be an affectionate reproach.",
      "Roughly, the same, with some of the subtleties that have been mentioned. It is also a word that you are more likely to hear in America. For example, it is not a word that we would use here in Ireland, though we would know it.",
      "Doofus by me in Eastern North America has no bite at all. Calling someone stupid is always mean. Calling someone a doofus is old-timey and/or minced oath sounding like \"heck\" or \"shoot\".",
      "\"Stupid\" is more general it can describe someone or something that lacks intelligence (like \"That was a stupid mistake\"). But \"doofus\" is more playful and less harsh it’s like calling someone a silly or clumsy person, not really mean-spirited. Like if my friend trips over nothing, I’d laugh and say, \"Nice one, doofus.\"\n\nFor making sentences with two words, it depends are you asking about *just* those two words together? Like \"stupid doofus\" (which sounds kinda funny tbh)? Or any two random words? Either way, context matters a lot!",
      "Stupid is an adjective and doofus a noun. So you can say that stupid doofus burnt dinner. \n\n\nIf people are being mean they can just say the one word stupid short for stupid person or stupid idea...

      "It is widely considered rude to refer to women simply as \"females.\" It sounds dehumanizing. \n\nYou have correctly understood that using female as a descriptor before some other word to describe a person like \"female vocalist\" or \"female manager\" is fine.",
      "Ok so the issue is using \"female\" or \"male\" as a noun when referring to humans, rather than an adjective. You could call somebody your female friend, for example (though, I would avoid that unless it's relevant to the conversation, in the same way you wouldn't refer to somebody as \"my black friend, Jim\" unless it were actually relevant to the conversation), but to say, for example, \"our tennis team has 5 females and 6 males on it\" reduces those people down to their biological sex and nothing else. \n\nDoes that make sense?",
      "The classic (bad, sexist) example is referring to \"men and females\". You'll also often hear crime reports that talk about \"males\". Both of these usages are dehumanizing and I would discourage you from using them as it makes the men and women in question sound like they're animals or test subjects, not real people.",
      "It’s a bit complicated and nuanced, but a good rule is you should try to use the terms “women” and “girls” (depending on which is appropriate) whenever possible. \n\n“Females” can be considered dehumanizing, _especially_ when a speaker/writer would use “guys/men/boys” in the same context. Recently, it tends to be often used in spheres where men make sweeping, reductive statements about women, so the connotation has become even worse. \n\ne.g. “Men like to xyz, whereas females like to abc” is very often considered degrading because men/women are getting different language treatment. \n\nEven in contexts when men are not explicitly referenced can carry this association, like “I was dating this female, and xyz”. In that sentence, “woman” or some equivalent is readily available, and it would be odd to hear the equivalent sentence with “male”, so this would be often considered degrading. \n\nHowever, there are some contexts where it’s completely acceptable: “In humans, the male reproductive system xyz, whereas the female reproductive system abc”.",

      "There’s definitely a negative social connotation as well. It’s kind of like a dog whistle for incel/misogynist beliefs and was popularized by harmful influencers like Andrew Tate. Speaking that way can give the impression that you see women as another species devoid from men entirely, even if that’s not the intention.",
      "It almost always sounds weird and/or rude. When used in media it often signals that the speaker is objectifying women, and probably doesn't interact with many women in their daily life.",
      "Usually if someone refers to women as \"females,\" such as \"females are \\[descriptor\\],\" or just use \"females\" as a replacement for \"women,\" it is at least rude, if not offensive. This terminology is most commonly used by misogynists, particularly common among the redpill community, and/or Andrew Tate and people aligned with him.",
      "Im a native English speaker and I always say \"female\" and \"male\". I always found it easier to use the clinical, professional term instead of doing all the nuances of: \"is this a man? Is this a boy? Is this a young man?\". \n\n\"She's going to the bar with her female friends.\"\n\n\"The females are all in the living room.\"\n\n^ These sound perfectly fine to me, not rude.",
      "There’s a subtle but very real difference in “She is female” and “She is a female.”  The former is fine. The latter should be avoided.",
      "I would definitely avoid using male and female as nouns for humans. It sounds derogatory and objectifying. It’s common police-speak also, with the same mood, or worse. A man, a woman; a female officer, a male suspect.",
      "Using \"female\" as a noun is typically considered rude in American English. The video you linked in the comments is apparently for comedic purposes. I personally wouldn't take it too seriously as a representative sample of the language. Some people do use \"females\" and \"males\" casually, with no disrespectful intention, but it can be complicated. Certain men do use \"female\" as a noun with emphatically dehumanizing, misogynist intention.\n\nContext also affects this; you will even notice \"male\" and \"female\" often used as nouns in law enforcement records and statements. For example, here's a Philadelphia police official describing a slain man.\n\n[“As they were approaching, a scuffle ensued with the male and the officers, at which point in time, the male produced a handgun from a bag that he was carrying on his person,” said Stanford.](https://whyy.org/articles/philadelphia-officer-involved-shooting-armed-suspect/)\n\nWhether the police shooting was justified or not, that language is dehumanizing. I'm sure Stanford would disagree, but I digress.\n\nIn any case, err on the side of caution and stick to using \"female\" and \"male\" as adjectives, not nouns.\n\nEDIT: Fixing typos.",
      "\"Female\" as a noun for humans in particular can be icky since that sort of language is often associated with some less than savoury groups so it can come off kind of yucky. It's less bad if you also refer to \"males\" at the same time but still typically a slight bit strange. It's not to say it's never acceptable, but it's definitely very context-dependant. You might see it in like, a scientific context, but I'd avoid it in usual speech since it can be kind of reductive/dehumanizing.",

    "text": "Lately I’ve been rethinking how I deal with procrastination, especially in english learning.\n\nA common metaphor is climbing a mountain—when you focus too much on the summit, and measure every step against how far you still are, it can feel overwhelming and demotivating. People often say, “Just look at your feet. One step at a time.” That helps, but I found another mental shift that works even better for me.\n\nInstead of looking at the summit as the goal, I started using the North Star as my metaphor. The **North Star** gives you **direction**, not distance. It’s so far away that there’s no point measuring how close I am to it. But if I know I’m moving in the right direction—even by a tiny step—I feel a sense of purpose. That’s powerful.\n\nFor example, I ask myself:\n\n* Am I becoming the kind of person who uses english naturally?\n* Does this small action (like reading a paragraph or listening for 10 minutes) align with that identity?\n\nIf yes, then even a small effort feels meaningful.\n\nThis mindset shift helped me stop obsessing over short-term goals like “reach B2 by August,” and focus more on building a life that includes the english. Now I think less about progress in miles, more about alignment in direction.\n\nCurious if anyone else has tried a similar mental reframe? How do you stay motivated in the long run?",
    "comments": [
      "    That's a really insightful way to approach motivation and consistency! Using the North Star as a metaphor is a great strategy because it helps you focus on your long-term aspirations rather than getting bogged down by immediate achievements or setbacks.\n    \n    For example, you might set a long-term goal such as becoming fluent in English, and then regularly check in with your daily habits to see if they align with that goal. You could ask yourself questions like, \"Am I practicing speaking every week?\" or \"Am I immersing myself in English media?\".\n    \n    This approach helps you feel more empowered by your progress, no matter how small, and reinforces the idea that every little action contributes to who you want to become.\n    \n    It's wonderful to see you exploring different ways to stay motivated.

      "So I looked into the backstory of the song and apparently this song is about Maria being a stripper, and the singer is trying to make her famous.\n\n\nIn this case, selling her out most likely is related to pimping, which is when a man has multiple women that he would manage and give out to customers to have a good time.\n\n\nSo he's saying \"Don't waste this chance I'm giving you\"",

      "\"Make it count\" - one person might say this to another as a reminder to seize an opportunity. To me, it often has a slight implication that they're casting doubt as well. Another common phrase is, \"This is your last shot. Make it count!\"\n\n\"Selling you out\" - someone's selling out another person when they're profiting from their misfortune. For instance, someone who's part of an organization but leaves because another organization paid them to. \n\nAll together, these lines suggest that the singer's offering the person he's talking to a reminder to seize the opportunity even though he might be unfairly profiting from her efforts. In the context of the song, it seems to mean that he's offering Maria encouragement to tell him her story but recognizes that he's going to make money for the song he's going to write about it. This song, however, has a lot of intentional vagueness and colorful language that leaves room for a lot of interpretation."

Its looks more like a method or a direct object of the verb **play**.\n\nIf I hadn't learnt the phrase already I might go like \"play with your strengths\" or \"play your strengths\".\n\nSo could someone please elaborate on the usage of **to** in this phrase?",
    "comments": [
      "\"play to\" is a phrasal verb. it's the kind of thing that makes us native speakers think, \"huh, I actually have no clue why we say it that way.\" https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/play%20to",
      "It's easier to analyze the phrase if we use a sports example.\n\n\n\nPlay *to* your strengths, in sports, would mean to play in such a way that forces your opponent (or like natural forces like physics or gravity, but the example is clearer with your opponent) to make a move that you know how to counter. For example, if you have a bad backhand in tennis, you could try to hit the ball in a way that tries to make your opponent return the ball to your forehand. The advice is not to just use your forehand, but to try to use your skills to make it easier for you by making it so you only have to use your forehand.\n\n\nPlay to your strengths doesn't mean do what you're good at. It means try to use whatever means you have to make it so you only have to do what you're good at. But in most examples, it ends up being about the same.",
      "I am not sure you have fully grasped the meaning of this phrase.  This phrase is an instruction advising you to capitalise on and leverage your abilities and talents. The preposition **to** is identifying a focus or direction for your effort. So when an actor is told to **play to** the audience in a scene they are being told to direct their performance towards the audience, not their fellow players. When I say the used-car salesman was **playing to** my vanity I am describing how he directed his sales schtick at my ego, leveraging my vanity. \n\nSo when we **play to x*\" we are focusing our efforts in a specific direction to capitalise on, gain from focusing in that direction.",
      "There’s not really any rhyme or reason; that’s just what we say. That’s kind of how it goes with prepositions a lot of the time",
      "This is an idiom which originates in sport.  \nIn sport, you want to move the ‘play’ towards the areas you are strong.  Hence the preposition to.",
      "You are not playing the strengths themselves, you are taking advantage *of* them.",
      "Lots of idioms use sporting analogies. You play games, such as football. If you play using your best abilities wisely, you're more likely to win.\n\nThe exact wording of idioms doesn't matter. They have a meaning that is independent of the individual words. They're set phrases.",
      "\"Play to(wards) your strength\" is the intended meaning",
      "Adding on, you can play to the audience or play to the music. They all have a sense that you are playing to something that you aren't really in control of, but they are influencing how you play. However, some speakers might not think of it the same way as I do. Prepositions are difficult because they have so many functions that are abstract and are very context dependent. \"Play to the audience\" could be describing what an actor is doing on stage literally or describing how an actor is taking the audience into account to inform their performance. A lot of prepositions will have vague metaphorical meanings that kind of make sense to native speakers, but we can't always explain why. You just have to learn them as you go along, but the more meanings you learn for each preposition, the more you start to see the bigger cloud of metaphors that each preposition is used for.\n\nIt might be interesting to take some common verbs that take many prepositions and see how each preposition changes each verbs meaning. Look at the literal meanings and the metaphorical meanings. How are 'play to' and 'play on' used? How about 'set to' and 'set on'? Then compare 'play to' and 'set to'. Then 'play on' and 'set on'. Try to come up with metaphors that connect each meaning, even if it's pretty silly. After all, it's pretty silly that a class of words so small can take on such wildly different meanings.",
      "It's the same use of \"to\" as in a phrase like \"appeal to\" or \"speak to.\"\n\n\"he appeals to my sense of charity by asking if I know there are children starving in Africa.\"\n\n\"but that doesn't speak to the ethical problems of such a project.\"\n\nAlso...\n\n\"play to your strengths\"\n\n\"appeal to your emotions\"\n\n\"speak to those issues\"\n\nIt's \"to\" in the sense of \"in the direction of\" or \"with regard to.\"\n\nIt really means \"play \\[with regard\\] to your strengths\"",
      "Play to maximize your strengths shortened to play to your strengths ",
      "Don't analyse why we use certain prepositions in fixed expressions; that way lies madness.\n\n\nWe use it because we use it. The same is true for phrasal verbs. Sometimes there's a logical reason (e.g. *quiet down* - we often put volume and other measurements on an up-down scale) and sometimes there's no real reason (e.g. *set off an alarm*).",
      "I didn't know the phrasal verb. That's very instructful. Thank you!",

Someone asks « what was that ? »\n\nYour answer could be “one of the balloons popped”, or “a balloon popped” or “a balloon” or if was me “what do you think”\n\nFor your second one you could say “they’re in my room” if it was already established that you were talking about balloons.",
      "They're all OK. Don't overthink things.",
      "You would only say \"one of the balloons popped\" if the other person was familiar with your 10 bedroom balloons. Otherwise they would be confused and probably reply \"the balloons??\"\n\n\"A balloon popped\" would be correct and in this case refer to \"a balloon nearby, the one you just heard\". Though unless it was common for there to balloons nearby, it would also prompt a followup question.",
      "\"A balloon popped\"  is fine this is not happening in isolation, there is context. Also this informs the person balloons were even there to begin with.\n\n\"A wall in my room\" is also fine. You presented a wall (any wall at all) then described it ( in my room)",
      "1. \"A balloon popped\" is better. \"One of the balloons\" is correct but it also implies the person you're talking to knows you have these balloons.\n2. \"The balloons\" vs \"they\" depends on if you have previously mentioned the balloons. If you say \"the balloons\" in one sentence, you can say \"they\" in a following sentence.",
      "Both are valid. You're better off being specific by saying one of the balloons (assuming the person knows about the balloons). ",

      "Both “one of the balloons” and “a balloon” work. Yes, you could replace “the balloons” with “they” in context, but I’m not sure how you could hang balloons on a wall.",
      "You can say \"a balloon popped\" because, whilst you're technically correct that it could mean any balloon anywhere in the world, context is our friend here. The person came to investigate a noise, so it's fairly obvious that by \"a balloon\", you mean one of the balloons in your room.\n\nAnyone that doesn't understand that is probably being deliberately obtuse.\n\n\"the balloons are hanging on one of the walls in my room\" is technically correct but EXTREMELY specific. Again, context helps us out. We can infer from the statement that you mean the balloons, and it doesn't matter which wall specifically in this context, so \"they're hanging on a wall in my room\" is perfectly fine.\n\nEven \"hanging\" is probably not needed here. \"They're on a wall in my room\" gives the same information.",
      "\"One of the balloons popped\" assumes that the listener can relate it to a previously mentioned context. He knows which specific balloon you mean. Without context you would say \"a balloon popped\". It could be any ballon, anywhere within hearing.",
      "I can't give a logical reason for this, but I think in this context, I would say “hanging on **the** wall in my room,” rather than “**a** wall.”\n\nAgain, I don't know why, but things hang on **the** wall rather than **a** wall unless there's some other context that drives the use of the indefinite article — like “I painted a wall in my room” i.e., specifying that it's not all four walls ... just one of them.",
      "So the difference between \"a \\[noun\\]\" and \"one of the \\[nouns\\]\" depends on context. Here, the person in the other room has just heard a sound and asked what the sound is. Even if they did not previously know there were balloons in your room, that context is enough that \"a balloon popped\" is a sufficient answer because it tells them the source of the sound they were asking about. \"One of the balloons\" includes additional information about the number of balloons in your room, which may or may not be relevant to a further discussion with the person. \n\nThe context is different in your sentence about where the balloons are hanging. \"On a wall in my room,\" without further context, suggests an ordinary room, and most readers would understand that (1) the balloons are hanging on a wall, and (2) the wall and the balloons are both in your room. Unlike \"one of the balloons,\" \"one of the walls in my room\" doesn't give much additional information. \"A balloon\" could mean there was one or more than one, whereas \"one of the balloons\" means there definitely was more than one. But we already know (or at least presume) that your room has more than one wall, so in this case \"one of the walls\" tells us that the balloons are hanging on one of the walls, and not more; that is, you don't have balloons hanging on two walls, or three. That could be important to the listener or not, depending on the context.",
      "For the balloon scenario, both responses would be appropriate.  \"A balloon popped\" does not seem to imply anything in particular about the balloon, but the listener will still understand your answer to refer to some balloon that has popped within earshot.  Everything else about the balloon is unimportant.\n\n\"One of the balloons popped\" is correct English usage and sounds natural, but will pique the curiosity of the listener if you have not already established to them that you have a number of balloons.  Having a number of balloons in your residence is unusual outside of the context of celebrating something, so they might take your comment to mean that you are having a celebration and ask you about the occasion.\n\nA certain type of person may even take \"one of the balloons popped\" as a joke.  With no other context, this answer implies that it is normal for you personally to always have a number of balloons around, which is sort of funny."

    "title": "A somewhat silly question about the verb 'expect' in the past tense",
    "text": "EDIT :\nThanks everyone for weighing in. I see now how between 1 and 2, a distinction can be drawn mostly stylistically, as pointed out almost unanimously in the comments. I'm more curious now about \"didn't expect to\" being used to refer to things that eventually did not happen. Is it 100% contextual?\n\nHi, here's my very nerdy question to native speakers :)\n\nCompare two sentences below:\n1. I didn't expect this to happen.\nVs\n2. I never expected this to happen.\n\nIn my understanding,  sentence (1) strongly implies that the thing that wasn't expected did actually happen in the end (=\"i didn't expect it but it did happen\"). Whereas sentence (2) can be understood more freely, depending on the context: \"I wasn't hoping for it to happen [and it didn't]\" also a possible interpretation.\n\nDo you agree?\n\nMost importantly, my other question is: can (1) depending on the context allow such an interpretation where 'this' eventually did NOT happen? Or would it be grammatically/semantically impossible, or simply lexically incorrect to be trying to express this meaning with the combination  of 'expect' + negative + past simple? \n\nSome other examples, with broader context:\n\n3. I didn't expect to find a good listener in her,  and indeed she ended up talking over all the time. \n\n4. I went to see that movie last night. I didn't expect it to be a masterpiece, and clearly it wasn't.\n\nDoes this usage of 'expect to...' in (4) & (5) sound slightly off, or is it okay? \n\n",
    "comments": [
      "There is no difference in insinuation in the first to imo",
      "I would not agree, no. You’re describing things that happened in the past, so if the “this” incident didn’t actually happen…you probably wouldn’t need to describe it. Like if I wasn’t shot in the street in the cold light of day, I don’t need to say I didn’t expect it to happen. In both of these sentences, it’s implied that whatever “this” is actually occurred. \n\nI would say that the biggest difference is that the implication of sentence two is much more serious/dramatic than sentence one. To me sentence one is like you’re doing a science experiment and get an unusual result. It’s like “huh. 🤔 didn’t expect that to happen.” \n\nSentence two on the other hand is like if your best friend is killed in a sudden car accident. It’s like “Oh my GOD. 😭 I never expected this to happen.” It’s like, something happened that is so crazy that the thought couldn’t even cross your mind.",
      "i think either could be used either way, but you're probably sensing a very real difference in which is _more likely_ to be used in the two situations.",
      "P.S. 3 is a bit wrong; \"she ended up and talking over\" doesn't make sense.\n\nMaybe just a typo?",
      "P.P.S. Apologies for missing this question,\n\n> an interpretation where 'this' eventually did NOT happen? \n\nNo. \n\nThey both imply that it's happened. You're describing \"this\". If \"this\" doesn't exist, then it doesn't make sense.\n\nYou'd need to rephrase it. Probably using the word \"but\".\n\n\"I thought it would happen, but it didn't.\"",
      "To me, the key word in examples 1 and 2 is actually “this”. A thing or event described as “this” is close to the speaker, and the easiest way to be close is if it actually recently happened. “That” event is a little farther away, and there could be many reasons why it’s farther away so “that” works for both did-happen and did-not-happen. But it would be very rare to say “I did not expect this” when “this” is not real.\n\nBack to comparing “did not expect” and “never expected”. To me, this one isn’t about whether it happened. Instead, “never expected” implies that your thought process would stay the same even given multiple opportunities to consider the question (whether real or hypothetical opportunities), and/or given different combinations of related circumstances. Your prediction may have been incorrect, but you never would have been *uncertain* about your prediction.\n\n“Did not expect” is not the opposite of this. It doesn’t imply that you were uncertain. It just doesn’t include that information at all. You can use that for any level of certainty.",
      "They're very, very similar.\n\nI think you're overthinking it.\n\nThe slight difference - in some contexts - is, the second implies that you'd thought about it before - i.e. you had given consideration to what might happen, even though it didn't. It focuses more on the possibilities.\n\nWhereas 1 is more \"ooh, wow, surprise\". Totally unexpected - impossible to predict. C/f. 2 is like... yeah, I could have worked out that that might happen, but I didn't.\n\nBut you're overthinking it.\n\nThey're *so* nearly the same.",
      "\"I didn't win, but I didn't expect to anyway.\"\n\n\n\"I won, but I didn't expect to.\" ",
      "Thanks! Meaning, to you both mean 'this' did eventually happen?",
      "Thank you so much for your input! I see it now.  I'm still very curious as to whether \"expect\" would allow usages like 3 and 4, where the event did not happen (it wasn't expected > it didn't happen).",
      "So we could say this just depends on the context, and both 3 & 4 sound alright?",
      "Indeed a typo! Thanks!",
      "No they don't. I'm with a friend, I receive a letter, I open it: it's from a college I applied to, and it's a rejection. My friend says, \"oh no, I'm sorry\" and I shrug and say \"I didn't expect to get in.\"",
      "Thanks a lot. So what about sentence 3 & 4? Would they similarly sound more natural with different endings, like below?\n3* ... but she listened with empathy and care\n4* ...but it was brilliant",

      "I think that's pushing credulity somewhat, because it says \"Sports is\", so it's talking about the entirety of that pursuit. The competition for sports, as a genre, would be e.g. computer games or board games - competing with sport, rather than competitors in sports games. Even if it said \"**the** competition\", it still doesn't make much sense, because what are they competing *with?* \n\nTechnically, I guess it could work. But it's probably not worth thinking about; these types of English exercise are often poorly constructed.",
      "Yes, agreed, if \"Sports\" were a single subject (say, at school), I could see that working in some scenarios. It's not one I've ever encountered in real-world usage so far.

      "\"Embrace\" here is a metaphor. Education does not have arms and cannot literally embrace anything. In this situation, you might find it helpful to think of \"embrace\" to mean \"include,\" or \"encourage,\" as in \"education should include imagination and morality.\" At the time that Dickens was writing, education focused a great deal on conformity, memorization, and repetition. In this sentence, he's encouraging his readers to \"embrace\" a warmer, softer style of education.\n\nSide note: the teacher in *Hard Times* is Mr. M'Choakumchild, which is a thinly veiled aptronym (when a character's name is apt or appropriate to their personality or behavior). Mr. M'Choakumchild sounds like \"choke the child.\"  I can't quite remember the scene correctly because I haven't taught the book in twenty years, but he demands that a student define a horse in very scientific terms with no tolerance for whimsy or creativity. \"You wouldn't walk on a horse, so a carpet should not have images of horses on them,\" or something along those lines.",
      "Oh, I think you're using \"embrace\" perfectly here! 😊 It sounds natural and fits the idea of education *welcoming* or *including* imagination and morality. Dickens would probably approve, he loved criticizing rigid education systems lol.",

      "no that logic doesn't follow at all. Using a semicolon like you suggested would be awkward and not what actual English speakers would actually write.   Yes, this is a sub to teach people how English is actually used.",
      "Thanks for backing me up. For those reading this and curious:\n\n☑️ Don’t take everything he says seriously, he loves to pull people’s legs (this error is called a [comma splice](https://www.grammarly.com/blog/punctuation-capitalization/comma-splice/) and is one of the most common English writing errors; if you use it in an essay you’ll lose a lot of points, and it’s not appropriate for professionally written/published work either, but it’s a common enough error that it’s permissible in casual contexts and most native speakers wouldn’t bat an eye (texting, social media, even the company Slack channel). Some poets and professional writers may even play with the error as part of the art form*, to evoke a certain feeling. It’s like how native speakers rarely use whom 🤷🏾‍♀️ grammatically incorrect, but the world keeps turning and language keeps changing, and some errors are more egregious than others in casual contexts.)\n\n✅❓Don’t take everything he says seriously, for he loves to pull people’s legs (if you add in a transition word, for instance a coordinating conjunction like *for* or [non-comma subordinating conjunction like *as*](https://langeek.co/en/grammar/course/767/as), between the clauses, [you’d make the previous sentence completely grammatical](https://owl.purdue.edu/owl/general_writing/punctuation/commas/extended_rules_for_commas.html) and appropriate for academic/professional/literary contexts. That being said, YMMV on whether people on social media would find your writing a bit too formal if you did this, and, with these specific independent clauses, it can sound unnatural/archaic to certain readers depending on the transition word you use.)\n\n✅ Don’t take everything he says seriously; he loves to pull people’s legs (grammatically correct and [good use of the semicolon](https://writingcenter.unc.edu/tips-and-tools/semi-colons-colons-and-dashes/); perfectly appropriate for professional written contexts and essays, but again, YMMV on whether netizens would find your writing a bit too formal in casual spaces)\n\n✅✅ Don’t take everything he says seriously. He loves to pull people’s legs. (If any of this confused you, just default to a period, English’s failsafe punctuation for two independent clauses <3)\n\n*for any nonnative speaker considering this in literary contexts, reminder that ***“you must know the rules to break them”*** and it *could maybe work*, but be careful.",
      "That's neat. You're wrong, and that's all that matters. \n\n\nAlso, \n\n\n> No, that\n\n\n> a sub for teaching people ",
      "I know, people come here to learn how to communicate with English speaking people, not archaic English textbooks.   The irony is that using a semicolon there would actually appear odd to the average person.\n\nIn fact even splitting them with a period would make it feel a bit unnatural since the two things are obviously part of the same thought. The comma gives it a smoother flow, better simulating how it might be spoken.",
      "So true!! Academic vs casual contexts and “appropriate grammar” vs. true everyday usage is an important delineator in this example and more generally in English. You could speak grammatically perfect English in the streets, but people still might view you as awkward 🤷🏾‍♀️ [this article](https://www.uncoverwords.com/tricky-grammar/why-some-sentences-sound-wrongeven-if-theyre-technically-right) talks about it in more detail than I want to type up 😅",
      "The majority of questions in this sub are framed as \"what sounds more natural?\".   Fitting in with English speaking society is their goal.  Americans/Canadians/Brits/Aussies all bend rules to the point where it effectively becomes the new rule, and language evolves.  Something isn't \"incorrect\" if it conveys the thought in a way the listener is conditioned to hear/read it.     \nThis is true of just about any language.   That's how we can tell when a customer service call center is based in India, their diction and pronunciation is ironically too perfect.   Similarly, 100% \"textbook\" perfect grammar and tones in Mandarin will flag you as a foreigner.",
      "Exactly!! All excellent points. Speaking fluently at the advanced level is just as much knowing when and how to break the rules as it is, well, actually knowing them.",
      "When I started with Mandarin, the advice I got that if you only learn Mandarin from Mandarin teachers, you will only be able to talk to Mandarin teachers.\n\nEnglish usage is more standardized in English speaking countries than Mandarin is in China/Taiwan, but the same idea applies here to an extent."

I want to know how you practice shadowing, how long you usually do it, and if you repeat the audio while it’s playing or if you pause and repeat. Also, I’d love to know what YouTube channels or videos you like to use for shadowing. I really want to improve my speaking and feel more confident Thanks a lot in advance!\n",

Let me know if you find it useful!",
      "Hey! I’ve been practicing shadowing too, and it’s helped me a lot with my pronunciation and flow. 😊 Here’s what works for me:\n\nI usually pick short clips (like 1-2 minutes max) and listen first to get the rhythm. Then I try to repeat while the audio is playing almost like an echo. At first, it was super hard to keep up, but it gets easier! I do this for like 10-15 mins a day so I don’t burn out.\n\nFor YouTube channels, I love **BBC Learning English** (their “The English We Speak” series is great for casual phrases) and **Rachel’s English** for pronunciation breakdowns. Also, random TED Talks or podcast clips work if you want more natural speed.",
      "ah nice! shadowing’s one of the best techniques out there if you do it right - but a lot of people kinda rush it and miss the real benefits.\n\nhere’s what worked best for me and people i’ve helped:\n\n1. Start slow, then go live.\n\n\n\nfirst few times: pause and repeat line by line. really get the rhythm, emotion, pronunciation.\n\nlater: try shadowing while it plays - but don’t worry if you miss a few words. it’s like learning to sing along with a song.\n\n\n2. Choose speakers with clear emotion + natural pace.\nTED Talks, vloggers, podcasts with casual convos = gold.\n\n\n3. Repeat the same clip multiple times.\nFirst focus on pronunciation, then intonation, then flow. You'll notice new stuff each round.\n\n\n\nGreat YouTube channels for shadowing:\n\nSpeak English with Vanessa (great for casual tone)\n\nEnglish Addict with Mr Steve\n\nBBC Learning English - News Review\n\nand honestly, even short Netflix scenes work well if you’re into acting it out a bit 😄\n\n\nbtw, i’ve been working on an app where you can do random-topic speaking practice after shadowing, and it gives you feedback on clarity and fluency. kinda connects passive learning with actual speaking output. hit me up if that ever helps!\n\nbut yeah - consistency > perfection. even 10 mins a day works wonders 💪",

      "standard isn't used this way in the US. \n\nin the US, we have kindergarten, 1st grade, 2nd grade... etc. ending with 12th grade. we typically say it like that, with the number first & the word \"grade\" second. students can be called \"first graders,\" \"second graders,\" etc. \n\n9th-12th grades are high school, and we also use the terms freshman (9th grade), sophomore (10th grade), junior (11th grade), and senior (12th grade). as in, \"it is my junior year.\" or \"he is a sophomore in high school.\"",

In the US it's \"sixth grade\", in Canada it's typically \"grade six\".   In the UK it's usually \"year 6\".   Don't know about Australia but I doubt they say \"standard\" either.",

    "comments": [
      "\"Drawing\" pictures doesn't fit with the verb \"do.\" Drawing is a gerund (a noun form of a verb, like building, dancing), and they don't typically work with \"do\"",
      "This is a cleft (or pseudo-cleft) sentence. **Cleft sentences** usually take the complement or object, and make it the focus of the sentence:\n\n*e.g. It's money that he wants.*\n\n(the normal sentence is: *He wants money.*)\n\nThis is done for emphasis.\n\nA **pseudo-cleft sentence** is a way of reversing a sentence with a copular verb (or 'linking' verb), like '*be*' or '*become*'. Pseudo-cleft sentences begin with question words (e.g. What, Why, Where), however in this case, the pseudo-cleft sentence begins with '*All*', which has the same meaning as '*the only things that*'.\n\nThe form in the second clause depends on the verb in the first clause. For example, '*need to*' is followed by **the bare infinitive**: \n\ne.g. *What you need to do is* **write** *him a letter.*\n\nNoun clauses starting with 'that' would use a normal verb in **indicative**:\n\ne.g. *All that matters is (that) she* **gets** *home safe.*\n\nWhereas verbs like '*enjoy*' are always followed by **'-ing'** so this would be in the second clause too.\n\ne.g. *The only thing I enjoy is walking in the forest.*",

      "A few simpler examples\n\nAll I did was send an email.\n\nAll he did was be kind.\n\nIt's not in -ing form because it's not an object of the sentence nor is it in continuous aspect,  but more of imperative form.\n\nBe kind to your sister!\n\nAll I've done is be kind!\n\nI wonder if it's a subjunctive structure. Looking forward to other answers.\n\nEdit: More examples that use this rule:\n\nWhat I need you to do is talk to your sister.\n\nThe only thing you should do is make me cookies.\n\nExploring these examples makes me consider the parallel with /do/​ in the first clause, which is the infinitive and may prompt the infinitive in the second.\n\nCompare:\n\nWhat I'm doing is sending you a letter.\n\nAll I'm doing is talking to you. ​\n\nThe verb is -ing in both cases. I think we have an answer.\n\nEdit 2: Removed commas eg What I did, was say hello. ​",
      "\"Draw\" is an infinitive verb form there, and these are also sometimes used in the same places as nouns (note that they do not become nouns though - you can tell it's still a verb because it has a direct object, \"pictures\").\n\nThis kind of structure (e.g., \"All I do is ...\") simply requires an infinitive as complement rather than an \"-ing\" form.\n\nYou can kind of compare it to how certain verbs can only take infinitives, e.g., \"I can read,\" not \"I can reading.\"",
      "It feels to me like its usage is verb, it’s just that the writer dropped the preceding “to”, which would be there if written more formally correct",
      "In some cases, The gerund and infinitive (I.E. \"Doing\" vs \"(To) do\", Etc.) are effectively interchangeable, \"I like walking\", \"I like to walk\"; \"I wanna go hiking\", \"I wanna go hike\" (Sometimes the word \"To\" is used, Sometimes not, It depends on the verb before, In this case \"Go\" doesn't have \"to\").\n\n\"Do\" is one of the aforementioned verbs that takes the bare infinitive (I.E. wothout \"To\" before it), So \"I didn't walk\" (Not \"I didn't to walk\"), \"All he does is talk\" (Not \"All he does is to talk\"), Etc. In this case you probably *could* use the gerund, \"All she'd usually do [...] was drawing\", And it'd certainly be understood, But it sounds more natural to use the infinitive \"Draw\", I'm not sure if there's actually a rule about it. In general though, If a verb is the object of the verb \"Do\" rather than another verb, It's probably best to put it in the infinitive. (For the examples I gave, \"I didn't walking\" doesn't make sense, \"All he does is talking\" works, But it sounds a bit weird and \"All he does is talk\" would probably be more common.)\n\n(N.B.: I'm not sure \"Object\" is really the best word, In a phrase like \"All he does is play tennis\", \"Tennis\" is the object, With \"Play\" I suppose acting as the main verb, But it's in some way connected to \"Does\". Perhaps \"Complement\" would be a more accurate term?)",
      "“She’d” and “was” sets the scene in past tense where drawing would make it present tense",
      "I believe, although not totally sure, to be some kind of subjunctive mood construction, I was initially basing the idea on the use of the word “usually” which may have put enough doubt into the sentence to knock it away from indicative. But now I believe it’s actually coming form the word before in “she’d”. The word being folded into she there is “would” indicates the possibility of the past tense potential subjunctive to me which dictates the verb usage “was draw” instead of the past continuous as you have suggested here.",
      ">Noun clauses starting with 'that' would use a normal verb in **indicative**:\n\n>e.g. *All that matters is (that) she* **gets** *home safe.*\n\n\nTbh it'd sound more natural to me to say \"Get\" there rather than \"Gets\".\n\nEDIT: Also wait, Why is \"That\" in parentheses? Would you say \"All that matters is she gets home safe\"? There are some cases where it feels natural to drop \"That\" (E.G. \"I think that he's coming\", \"I know that he will\"), But in this particular case it'd sound really weird to me without \"That\", I'm genuinely not even sure I'd understand it, Not without thinking about it a bit.",

    "comments": [
      "Cross and play both describe the complete action. If you saw him cross the street it's implied you saw the entire journey. Similarly with play football.\n\nIf you saw him crossing the street, it merely implies you saw him when he was half way but didn't continue watching until he reached the other side. If you go to watch him playing football, there is again a hint that you may not see the entire match.\n\nThese are not absolutely set in stone, though, so there is some leeway.",
      "I don't have the formal English language education to explain why, but when using \"watch\", \"play\" is correct, \"playing\" is not.\n\n\"I watched him play football\" is how it would naturally be said.  \n\"I *saw* him *playing* football\" also sounds correct to me. To mean \"when I saw him, he was playing football\" rather than the first one which has more of an \"I went intentionally to watch him play\" connotation.\n\nThough \"I watched him playing football\" sounds wrong. I can't explain why and it feels like it should be grammatically correct, it's just not something we'd say. I think it has something to do with tenses? It almost has a kind of creepy \"and he didn't know\" connotation, weirdly.\n\nOn the other hand, both 'cross' and 'crossing' scan perfectly fine. \"I saw him cross the road\" and \"I saw him crossing the road\" both feel perfectly fine, though they have slightly different meanings to me.\n\n\"I saw him cross the road\" = that's a thing that he did, and I can vouch for that because I saw him do it.  \n\"I saw him crossing the road\" = when I saw him, he was in the act of crossing the road.\n\nI have no qualifications in English other than being born here - and technically, being from Cornwall, even that's debateable. :p\n\nEdit: Thinking about it more, it's definitely \"a tense thing\", and my cross/crossing explanation explained why playing is wrong. \"Playing\" implies it was a thing that was going on when you were there. Whereas \"watched\" implies that it's a thing in the past that has concluded. \n\nYou watched a TV show, or you're watching a TV show. You can't \"watched\" something that's still happening. So you can't have \"watched\" someone \"playing\" football, because \"watched\" implies you've done it, but the \"playing\" implies it's still happening. That's why it sounds wrong.\n\n'Saw' doesn't have the same implication as 'watched', because you can see something, without necessarily seeing all of it. Which is why \"I saw you yesterday at the shops!\" is fun, but \"I watched you yesterday at the shops\" is probably ending in an arrest.\n\n  \n... am I talking absolute crap here?",
      "“Cross the street” suggests that the action is complete and that it is the completeness of the action that is important. I saw him cross, now I know he’s on the other side. \n\n“Crossing the street” is on going (but still past). It may suggest that you didn’t observe the completion of the crossing or could be leading in to there having been something about the manner in which he crossed or an event that occurred during the cross that is going to be the important thing. Or it could just suggest you watched him for a while rather than having just looked up to confirm that it happened. In a lot of sentences and a lot of contexts there might be no real difference but it’s a matter as to whether you’re describing it as an event that happened at a point in time or an (at the time) I -going event that occurred for a duration.",
      "Cross or crossing would both be fine. In your second sentence only play works. Playing is wrong.",

      "Yes, there's a dynamic in an -ing ending, whereas without there is a sort of 'finished' sense to it.\n\nIt's quite likely in conversation no-one would really spot the difference - it's not an absolute - but they hint in different directions.",
      "They are both fine.\n\nI saw him play, or I saw him playing.\n\nThere is a slightly different nuance. Using the continuous makes it an active event; like you watched him scorING a goal, or playING well, over time. Using the simple tense is more of a formal report of the event; more passive.\n\nBut the difference is minor. They are both perfectly OK.",
      "Yeah, I edited my post after as I realised it wasn't necessarily 'wrong', just means a slightly different thing.\n\n\"I saw him playing football the other day\" implies that it was more of an incidental thing. You saw him the other day, and he was playing football at the time.\n\n\"I watched him play football the other day\" implies you specifically set out to watch the game.\n\n\"I watched him playing football the other day\" I'm still not sure on, the mixture of tenses gives it a creepy vibe.",

      "To be, or not to be, that is the question.\n\n\"Should\" says it ought to be like it; an opinion. Omitting that word means it MUST be like it, It has to be.\n\nThe piece claims that Gates was delusional in his adamant belief that it WAS like the Mac.",

In that the “delusion” is acting as the primer to convey a want or desire for the subjunctive “be”. If so, then the sentence should read like “that Windows (must) be like the Mac” which I believe is the correct way to read this line. Love to hear what you think though.",
      ">It's a bit strange to see it used with \"delusion\" (but it works in this context).\n\nDoes it work? I mean, I understand the intention, but it's not really a logical use of language.",
      "It’s not wrong. It’s not even unconventional. It’s not even slang. It’s perfectly correct English",

      "Which is a reasonable interpretation from context, but improper usage of the word. Sorry, I'm not trying to be a dick about this (and possibly failing), I can just see how the clumsy sentence structure might cause further confusion around the subjunctive for somebody who's learning the language.\n\nThe Oxford Languages definition of 'delusion' is 'a false belief or judgment **about external reality**, held despite incontrovertible evidence to the contrary', which makes the subjunctive mood inherently inappropriate. It should either be 'Gates's persistent delusion that Windows *was* like the Mac' or another word entirely.",

      "To quote from the mighty Wikipedia: 'Subjunctive forms of verbs are typically used to express various states of **unreality**, such as wish, emotion, possibility, judgment, opinion, obligation, or action, **that has [sic] not yet occurred**.' So pairing the subjunctive mood with something like 'delusion' – which explicitly references **reality** – is incoherent.",
      "But in that very definition it states that a delusion is a false belief that is not in line with reality which seems to be exactly in line with the “unreality” found in subjunctives. Cambridge dictionary defines delusion as “something a person believes and wants to be true, when it is actually not true”. My definition doubly reinforces the subjunctive by referencing the state of wanting and showing that it’s not true which helps move it from the indicative mood, at least to me it does.",
      "The key part is 'something a person believes … to be true', i.e. from the perspective of the deluded, the delusion and the current reality are indistinguishable. In the case of a wish or a hope, the subject appreciates their wish or hope is currently unfulfilled. Compare the following:\n\n1. He believes the sky is green. (simple present)\n\n2. He believes the sky were green. (subjunctive)\n\n3. He wishes the sky were green. (subjunctive)\n\n4. He wishes the sky is green. (simple present)\n\n1 expresses a delusion, but it requires the simple present tense ('is') to do so. Substituting it with the subjunctive creates a sentence that is nonsensical. In 3 and 4, the inverse is true.\n\nI appreciate that doesn't provide a very satisfying explanation in the abstract, and maybe I misspoke with my previous comment, but hopefully that clarifies things a bit?",
      "I don't have the grammatical information to contribute to this, but I would like to say that the subjunctive would be used (i'm still a learner) with \"delusion\" in Spanish (which has a robust subjunctive system), but not your example 1.\n\"su ilusión de que Windows *fuera* como Mac\" & \"Él cree que el cielo *es* verde\"\nI know it's not the best practice to compare language to language, but I thought it could be relevant somewhat.\nIf it turns out I'm wrong on this, discúlpame, I'll delete this."

      "You can try **A Student’s Introduction to English Grammar**. It’s made for university students and goes pretty deep into grammar.",
      "*A Grammar of the English Language Volume 1 & 2* by George Curme are excellent sources on English grammar. They are at quite an advanced level and the speech within them may be a bit old-fashioned, but they have served me well countless times over the years.",
      "You can try Advanced Grammar in Use by Martin Hewings.",
      "For grammar, I’ve heard a lot of people recommend **\"English Grammar in Use\" by Raymond Murphy** (the blue one for intermediate learners). It’s super clear and has exercises to practice. I’ve been working through it myself, and it helps a ton with those little rules you kinda know but don’t really know, y’know?\n\nIf you want something more advanced, **\"The Cambridge Grammar of the English Language\"** is like the bible of English grammar, but fair warning it’s dense. Maybe check it out if you’re really serious about linguistics-level stuff.",

      "I'm a native English speaker in the US. I've taught English as a second language to adult adults from all over the world. My advice is not only to just watch TV in English, but to stand or sit in front of the TV and insert yourself into the scenes of programs, especially \"soap operas\". Pretend you're one of the characters, or an extra person in the scene, and respond to what's being said. Maybe try to guess what the other character is going to say in response to the person who has just spoken to him.\n\nAlso, because television news usually has better grammar than sitcoms, watch the news and repeat after the reporters. Do this out loud. If you're home alone, that's even better. There are other people in your house, they can just learn to deal with you talking to the TV. Good luck!

    "title": "Present perfect is mysterious to me",
    "text": "Hi everyone!\n\nIt's in the title: I am coming here for some enlightenment. I feel like I understand pretty well when to use the present perfect: to talk about undated past experiences, events that finished very recently and overall events that still connect to the present (am I right ?) (even if the latest doesn't always make sense to my non-native English speaker's brain, as presently talking about past events seems enough to it for them to be connected).\n\nHowever when I think about some examples, I am left with questions. Let's say that I have to explain to someone that my friend is not coming to their party because her leg is broken. I feel like I could actually use preterit as well as present prefect, the last one allowing me to focus on the fact that the leg is still broken (and that my friend can't walk as a consequence, or something) : \"She isn't coming because she broke her leg\" / \"She isn't coming because she's broken her leg\". However if one were to use the preterit tense, would the other speaker not understand that my friend's leg is still broken? Is my example just a bad one or can such a misunderstanding happen if one were to choose the wrong form?\n\nAny additional info about preterit/present perfect is welcome!",
    "comments": [
      "Something no one's mentioned yet is that using the present perfect in situations like your example sentences is more common in the UK. I think Americans tend to use simple past (preterit I guess) when possible. To me the present perfect sounds \"fancy\" or kind of British in this usage. \n\nSimilarly, when making sentences that use \"just\" or \"already\" I think Americans also tend to use simple past.\n\n\"I already ate.\" (more American) vs \"I've already eaten.\" (more UK)\n\nI've noticed my friend from the UK sometimes uses present perfect when I (American) would use simple past. In fact I think you can usually use simple past, the only exception I can think of is a sentence like \"I've lived in Japan for three years\", this means you still live there. If you say \"I lived in Japan for three years.\" it means you don't live there any more. That's what comes to mind at least.",
      "I would assume the leg is still broken in either of those sentences, and both make sense and work grammatically. In this case, there’s very little difference between the two. That’s not always true, but the context here makes the meaning clear.",
      "Both of your examples would work just fine.",
      "Never heard of the preterit tense in English, but on investigation, it turns out to be the past tense, as in your example. The use of the present perfect makes it clear that the leg is still broken. Although one might assume the same from the use of the past tense, there is a possibility that it is now healed and her inability to come is a consequence of the broken leg, such as having to catch up with her studies or work now she is fully fit.",
      "Let's tease the leg-breaking examples apart.\n\nShe's not coming to the tournament because she's broken her leg\nShe's not coming to the tournament because she broke her leg\n\nThese are about the same.\n\nShe's not coming to the tournament because she broke her leg half a year ago.\n\nAnd so the real difference is here - the pp implies that she's not coming because her leg is still broken, the past tense because she broke her leg (but it doesn't have to still be broken, it might just have ruined her chance at training for the tournament!)",
      "In the example you provided, either would work. However, as someone else mentioned, \"she has broken her leg\" sounds like something more recent (and is a bit less natural, IMO, almost like you are from England). Saying that she \"broke her leg\" doesn't mean the leg is healed, it just means the incident itself was isolated to the past.\n\nIt can be hard to predict which one to use, unfortunately. A lot of examples are fixed constructions where only one will work, and it gets more confusing when you add the continuous e.g. \"I've been helping my grandma\" vs. \"I have helped my grandma\" vs. \"I helped my grandma.\"\n\nMy recommendation is to use the preterite as the default and switch to the present perfect in situations you are sure about or where you hear native speakers using it. Non-native speakers are not reliable indicators and often get this wrong.",
      "While both would be understandable, in my opinion the first (\"She isn't coming because she broke her leg\") sounds more natural. However, I’m also an American. British English uses present perfect more often than American English. Therefore, the correct use of present perfect depends on whether you are learning American English or British English.",
      "In your example, saying \"She has broken her leg\" sounds like you're reporting \"fresh\" news closer to now whereas \"she broke her leg\" is something that occurred in the past and was completed and taken care of in the past, like it's not connected to the present at all. There was some time between the leg being broken and now.\n\nThe present perfect tense tells you something happened = true but nothing about when it happened, or how many times. It may even still be going on right now!\n\nThere's such a thing as \"weasel words\" where we can try to misdirect or say things that are technically correct by the rules but not answering what someone is asking about and answering in the present perfect is one of the ways to avoid saying something.\n\nLike if I say \"I cheated on a test\" then people are probably going to hear \"I cheated on a test in the past (once or twice)\". Whereas if I say \"I have cheated on a test\" that is technically correct for everything from cheating once to cheating on every single test I've ever taken and even the test I'm currently taking now (I'm trying to cover up that I've done this thing many times and I am even currently doing it!).\n\nOut of curiosity I looked up \"present perfect\" online to see what official stuff says. Here's [the first site](https://learnenglish.britishcouncil.org/grammar/english-grammar-reference/present-perfect) that comes up for me.\n\nIt says to use it for something that started in the past and continues into the present:\n\n* She has lived in Liverpool all her life (she has lived there her whole life and still is living there)\n* She lived in Liverpool all her life (she died, never having lived anywhere other than Liverpool)\n\nOr for an experience up to the present:\n\n* I've seen that film before (this is more like \"I am familiar with this film, but it's sort of fuzzy and I can't remember specifics about it\")\n* I saw that film before (this sounds more solid like you definitely remember the film and could talk about it)\n* I've played the guitar ever since I was a teenager\n   * I played the guitar since I was a teenager (\"since\" sort of clashes with \"played\" because \"played\" sounds \"complete and over\")\n* He has written three books and he is working on another one (sounds like 'the writing' is an ongoing matter, it's not closed or finished)\n* He wrote three books and is working on another one (the 'he wrote' just sounds \"final & completed\" like he wrote his 3 books and said all he had to say)\n\nI have a coworker who is Polish and he told me the hardest thing about English is the verb tenses. The thing with our verb tenses is we use them to talk about when the action happened, whether the action is complete or on-going, and what the relationship is with other actions is (before or during or after).",
      "\"She isn't coming because she broke her leg\" is fine.\n\nOr \"She isn't coming because she HAS broken her leg\".",
      "It sounds as if you understand the present perfect very well.\n\nIn your example, the context (\"She’s not coming because …\") makes it clear that you’re talking of a present situation.  The listener can then deduce that her leg is still broken.  But when a listener doesn’t have those contextual clues, we may need the present perfect.",
      "You're right about the present perfect generally connecting past events to the present, but yeah, sometimes the lines feel blurry. In your example, both \"she broke her leg\" (simple past) and \"she's broken her leg\" (present perfect) work, but they give slightly different vibes. With the simple past, the focus is just on the action happening, while the present perfect kinda hints that it still matters now (like you said, her leg’s still broken). Most native speakers would assume the leg is still healing either way, unless you specify otherwise (e.g., \"she broke her leg last year, but she’s fine now\").",
      "Even though they are not exactly the same they are often interchangeable. Context goes a long way in clearing up ambiguities, and if someone isn't sure what you mean they can always ask for clarification.",
      "Perfect tenses are just as they appear - it tells how an event happen and there's no going back. This is why in the case of future perfect tenses, you got to be extremely confident to use them since it implies how you can potentially eat all of your words in shame.",
      "Thank you for your insight!",
      "Can you think of an example where the difference would be significant?"

    "text": "I'm learning English, and I’ve noticed that the word “jack” is used very often — for example, in lumberjack, jack of all trades, and many other expressions I can’t remember right now. Also, in Fight Club, there were some confusing moments when the narrator said things like “I am Jack’s right liver.”\n\n",
    "comments": [
      "Jack, along with being a common name, is an old fashioned word for guy pretty much.",
      "[There was a thread about it a little while ago.](https://www.reddit.com/r/EnglishLearning/comments/1ki73fa/the_word_jack/)",
      "Jack is a familiar nickname for John (the most common men’s name in English for centuries, though no longer). Jack is often used as an Everyman in figurative language or in traditional stories.  He shows up, for example, in “Jack and Jill went up the hill”, “Jack and the Beanstalk”, “The House that Jack Built”. Pretty much every child knows these usages. Jack Tar is a generic name for a British sailor. “Every man Jack” is a  way of saying every man. The lowest ranking picture card in a deck of cards is a Jack. \n\nSo Jack came to be used for all kinds of tools, and people. You jack up a car to change a tire, using a jack. You might not know jack, but you might hear about him.",
      "He could be just any Juan",
      "You don’t know jack!",
      "We’ve also got car jacks to lift your car up to change a tire, phone jacks to plug in a phone line, and just plain old jacks which are like tiny metal caltrops which kids use to play games with.",
      "And “Jack” is a loanword from the Norman English. “Jacques” was heard by the true Englishmen as “Jack”. Which encapsulates part of the story of English",
      "It's like, just a guy I'm pretty sure. An average Joe, if you will.",
      "Remember never say hijack on an airplane ✈️ 🤣 ( hi Jack 👋)",
      "In Fight Club, the narrator was in the Paper Street house reading a magazine, and talks about \"an article written by an organ in the first person.\"\n\n\"I am Jack's medulla oblongata. Without me, Jack cannot regulate his heart rate, blood pressure, or breathing. There's a whole series of these.\"\n\nThis is modeled on a series of articles in Reader's Digest that used the name Joe.",
      "Jack (a nickname for John) is a very common name in English, and was historically SO common that it essentially became synonymous with “man” or “fellow.” In your Fight Club example, he calls himself Jack to essentially mean “everyman.” It’s like calling yourself “John Doe.”\n\nReferences to “Jack” are also usually references to tasks that might be performed by a random assistant or servant. That’s where we get “lumberjack.” This evolved into “Jack” also meaning the TOOLS for tasks that might have been performed by an assistant. For example: you don’t need your human friend Jack to lift up your car when a jack (a mechanical device for lifting cars) will do.\n\nFrom there, “jack” also became a verb meaning to lift something, and “jacker” became an adjective meaning to rob or to steal (i.e. to literally lift something and carry it away). That’s where we get words like “hijack” (“highway jacker” - person who robs stagecoaches on the highway) and to “jack in” (to hack your way into a computer)\n\nTl;dr - you’ll see “jack” everywhere in the English language. It usually means either “common man”, “lift”, or “steal.”",
      "Good etymology and history [of Jack](https://www.etymonline.com/word/Jack)",
      "Yeh, it is used quite a bit. For example, Jack off. It means to beat it. When people say beat it they can mean that you should get out of here.",
      "He is the patron saint of the English Language. He exists to make it more confusing. He loves the word \"sesquapedalianism\". We hate Jack. (Jk I don't know either)",
      "Interestingly, jack, john, and guy were all common names before becoming common terms for a man."

    "comments": [
      "I don't believe this rule is really accurate as written. It really should say something like \"Generally speaking, we do not use *many* in affirmative sentences in everyday conversational English.\" It's pointing at a real phenomenon, but oversimplified.",
      "We don’t use the mass-noun quantifier “much” affirmatively—you don’t say “I have much orange juice,” even though you can say “I don’t have much orange juice”—but the count-noun quantifier “many” can be used either way.  They have many choices.  He has many sweaters.  I have many of the same books that you do.  As others have pointed out, “clothes” is a weird word to use for that example.",
      "I think this rule is quite useful, at an appropriate level.  Of course, in some contexts, with some fixed phrases and with some registers, you can use many in a statement in a way that is grammatically correct.  However, this is a rule of use and helps lower-level learners understand how to understand and use quantifiers in the majority of sentences they will find.",
      "Not very.\n\nThe response to that question could in fact be just \"Many.\"\n\n'I have many clothes' doesn't flow as well or sound very natural but there's nothing really wrong with it.\n\n> Just when I learned this rule I found something that completely contradicts it\n\nThat explains English in a nutshell.\n\nAlthough I'm not sure your example is an affirmative sentence. It doesn't seem to be a response to a question. Also the continuous tense changes things.",
      "I don't think it's a useful \"rule\". I can immediately think of common expressions that contradict it.",
      "The problem with the \"clothes\" example is not that the sentence is affirmative, rather it's because \"clothes\" is uncountable and you can't use \"many\" with an uncountable noun. The example itself is correct but the reasoning is wrong. There's nothing inherently wrong with using \"many\" in an affirmative sentence.",
      "Unfortunately, colloquial English isn’t tightly rule driven. \n\n“Have you got a lot of shoes?”, “Sure, I have too many. Much of my shopping is online, and many times I just push the BUY button”.",
      "I wouldn't use \"many\" with \"clothes\". But I might use it with \"shoes,\" for example. \"My daughter has many shoes.\" \"There are many shoes near the door.\"\n\nI might also say \"a lot of\", though. In general, I don't think correct usage is as simple as that text would suggest.",
      "They're wrong. We do use \"a lot\" a lot, but you can certainly use many in an affirmative sentence like I have many books or I have many friends.\n\nWhat you can't do is use many as a partitive. For example, you can't say I have many milk or I have many stuff. You have to say I have a lot of milk\n Basically you can use it with plurals",
      "I’ve definitely used “many” in affirmative sentences, but the more I think about it the more “a lot” sounds more fitting. I think there’s a subconscious element of “a lot” sounding a little more exaggerated, which often reinforces an affirmation. Sort of like saying “do” in an affirmative sentence. Both are correct for countable nouns.",
      "Since it is from a textbook, I really believed it! Thank you for the clarification",
      "*Many* can be used with *clothes* just fine. It's one of those nouns that are always plural.",

    "comments": [
      "The use of past perfect in the first clause isn't normally an error with '*after*', but because you gave the year (1985), it implies that the action that followed (relationship) was not in that year, because the past perfect indicates a completed period.\n\nActually, your grammatical error is in the second clause. You put the state of being in a relationship in **present continuous** (or **present progressive** in US English). We generally avoid using continuous verbs (be + verb-ing) with **states** (or **stative verbs**). It's better to say '*I had a relationship with her / I was in a relationship with her*'.",
      "[deleted]",
      "\"After I had met my girlfriend\" (with or without a specific time qualifier) implies that the action (meeting) was over and done with before what you go on to describe next. Strictly speaking, meeting someone *can* be a one-off thing, but it sounds jarringly disjointed if you're describing a long-term relationship with that same person, as if meeting her and forming a relationship with her were either entirely unrelated or discrete phases of a sequence. If you met her once at a party and then only became lovers three years later, you *could* use the past perfect, but even then it would sound more natural to stick to simple past for narrative flow and immediacy. \n\nContinuous tenses don't work well with stative verbs, or in any case where the 'action' (such as it is) is inherently ongoing by its very nature. We tend only to use \"was having\" or the like: \n(i) as part of set phrases that indicate a non-stative action (such as \"she was having toast for breakfast\" or \"he was having a heart attack\"); \n(ii) where there are repeated episodes in a single phenomenon (e.g. \"he was having problems with his telephone\" or \"she was having a nightmare of a day\"); or \n(iii) where you are establishing a routine, habit or propensity (e.g. \"as teenagers, they were going swimming two or three times a week\" or \"I was always stubbing my toe on the furniture\").",
      "Honestly before we even get to grammar, \"I was having a relationship with her\" is not something we ever say. You *had* a relationship or *were in* a relationship, but not *was having* a relationship.\n\nA lot of the time adding the \"had/have\" to the past tense 'sounds' excessive. For example: \"I had gone to the store before you had arrived\" sounds \"complicated\" or \"heavy\". There's nothing 'incorrect' about this and it doesn't sound bad, it just sounds excessively wordy. Saying \"I went to the store before you arrived\" communicates the same thing.\n\nThe way the AI corrected your sentence to \"after I met... I had a relationship\" sounds fine.\n\nI think it's more important to get the \"vibe\" of the tenses. The past perfect tense is used to say something finished and was done before something else in the past happened or started. Like the past perfect tense is telling you about an action or something that happened two steps back.\n\n* \"*I had begun to use swear words* \\[2 steps back\\] by the time I went to school \\[1 step back\\]\"\n* \"*The company had deleted the files* \\[2 steps back\\] before she started to look for them \\[1 step back\\]\"\n* \"*We had already eaten dessert* \\[2 steps back\\] when they arrived \\[1 step back\\]\"\n* \"The day *after the dog barfed up all the cake it had eaten* \\[2 steps back\\], the house began to stink \\[1 step back\\]\"\n\nIn thinking of example sentences to put here for the past perfect, I'm thinking of a lot of sentences with \"already\" and \"when\" and \"by the time\" and \"before\" sorts of words in them. These are all pieces that connect ideas in time order.\n\nAbout the \"was having a relationship\", this is a progressive tense indicated by the -ing. \n\nThere was a post on tenses a few weeks or month ago and the main point we talked about is that some of these more elaborate tenses are typically used to \"set the scene\" and be the background for another action to occur in front of.\n\nThe -ing tenses are very often a background action that is ongoing that something else is going to happen in front of as a discrete action.\n\n* \"I was dancing on the stage \\[setting the scene\\] when the light fell and hit me \\[action\\]\"\n* \"It was starting to rain \\[setting the scene\\] so I shut the window \\[action\\]\"\n* \"While shutting the window \\[setting the scene\\] I saw the car in the driveway \\[action\\]\"\n* \"I am writing this comment \\[setting the scene\\] and can hear the neighbor mowing his lawn \\[action\\]\"\n* \"I am going to need to mow mine as well \\[setting the scene\\] before it rains \\[action\\]\"",

    "comments": [
      "\"without so much as\" means \"without\", i.e. none at all. In fact, it indicates not only that there is no electricity, but also no better things than electricity. It means \"they came from a village that did not *even* have electricity\".\n\n\"without so much\" means \"without very much\", i.e. very little.",
      "> They came from a village without so much electricity.\n\nThis sentence is a bit odd, but it can be read as having basically the same meaning as: “They came from a village without much electricity.” In fact, it sounds much more natural without the “so.” Perhaps we’re talking about a village where most houses are not connected to a power grid. \n\nIf we’re making an implicit comparison, the “so” is more natural:\n\n> [We have a lot of electricity.] They came from a village without so much (≈ **as much**) electricity.\n\n———\n\n> They came from a village without so much as electricity.\n\nThis means: “They came from a village that, surprisingly, had no electricity and none of the things that depend on it.”\n\n“Without so much as [a thing]” is a phrase that means “without [a thing] that is expected” or “without even [a thing].”\n\n> He disappeared without so much as a by-your-leave.\n>\n> He left without asking if it was okay[, but it was expected that he should have asked].\n\n> Then he stormed out without so much as a goodbye.\n>\n> He left without saying goodbye[, which was rude].\n\n> He escaped the accident without so much as a scratch.\n>\n> He escaped the accident without any injury[, which was surprising].",
      "\"Without so much as X\" means that they don't even have X (or don't do X, depending on the context). Another example:\n\n\"He arrived at school without so much as a pen.\" - He didn't even have a pen when he arrived at school.\n\n\"Without so much X\" means they do have X, but not a lot of it. So the first sentence means the village *does* have electricity, but not a lot of it, and the second sentence means the village doesn't even have electricity at all.",
      "\"Without so much\" carries an implication of scarcity (as in, we don't have a lot of it), while \"without so much as\" implies a complete lack of something (as in, we have none at all).",
      "\"They came from a village without so much electricity\" implies \"Their village had a little bit of electricity.\" This sounds awkward and I would not advise using it. It sounds like there is missing context. Maybe it would make more sense if you were just talking about another area that has a lot of electricity, and you are contrasting it to the village. It would be better to say \"They came from a village where access to electricity is hard to find.\"\n\n\"They came from a village without so much as electricity\" implies \"Their village did not have any electricity.\" This sounds very conversational and informal. Depending on the tone, it might even sound condescending. The wording \"so much as\" implies that it is shocking to imagine it. It's so crazy that their village didn't have electricity! If you didn't want that implication, you could just say \"They came from a village without electricity.\"",
      "it means that they came from a village that didn't even have electricity.  In other words, the village had nothing at all, not even electricity."

      "You want talk not sound like caveman, need grammar.",
      "Grammar is necessary to learn in order to speak a language fluently; however, “learning” doesn’t have just one path and it doesn’t necessarily have to be active. You can passively learn (acquire) grammar (this is how native speakers learn), but for an adult learner, this isn’t very practical unless you’re spending a significant amount of time immersed in the language—and even then, it’s faster and easier to actively learn. \n\nIt takes native speakers years of constant input in critical stages of development to be able to produce a grammatically correct sentence. This isn’t really feasible for older children, adolescents, or adults. \n\nIt’s also possible to be able to understand a language (reading/listening) without being able to produce the language (writing/speaking) at the same level. You may understand the words spoken, but not comprehend the nuance, exact meaning, or be able to reproduce it organically yourself. \n\nIn short, if you’re struggling with grammar, as you mention you are, then yes, you should be putting in active effort to learn it—at least if your goal is fluent communication. That is the most efficient method. Passively trying to acquire it is unrealistic for almost all—if not all—people who are not very young.",

If you make grammar mistakes, people might not understand you, or may misunderstand.\n\nIt's not at all essential to learn all the technical terms. About 90% of native English speakers wouldn't be able to tell you what a preposition is - they just use them, naturally.\n\nThe most effective way to learn English is by speaking it a lot, making lots of mistakes, and learning from them. *Focusing* on the \"rules\" can be counterproductive. Most \"rules\" have lots of exceptions, and there are often exceptions to the exceptions, so it can make you more confused than ever. Instead, you will eventually learn what \"sounds right\", and what doesn't - without being able to explain the technicalities.",

If you want to learn the language fully and be able to communicate well with native speakers it's extremely important, but if you don't need it enough to justify spending years on learning it then that's up to you.\n\n\nAs someone who studies the dead language of Old English and can't ever achieve fluency in it because no native speakers exist, I probably understand better than most why some people might want to be able to read a language more than speak it. Since Modern English isn't a dead language most people will assume if you want to learn English it's to speak it, but learning a language to fluency takes years and if you don't have a lot of use for it then fluency may not be right for you.",

You can watch a tree grow, but not a knee, it's a nonsense sentence. The commentor is hoping the speaker will just stumble through the sentence before realizing it's a racist af attempt at a prank.\n\n(In the US, the word 'negro' and its derivatives was a very common, very derogatory term during the slave era; and once slavery ended it was used to harass and intimidate black people, sometimes even resulting in killing a black person. Racism could legally be enforced up until the 1960s, and this word was a major part of the 'social control' that racists would use to intimidate black people into doing \\[whatever\\], or punish them for imagined offenses. It even happened that black people would be murdered, sometimes for non-existent crimes, and \"no one knew who did it!\" because the racist (usually white) person or people were supported in \"teaching them n---rs a lesson!\" or something similar. Black people were literally murdered in order to intimidate the whole population, and enough people in the town/area supported it with the result that the murderer(s) would never go to court. To say the word was used to abuse is an understatement.\n\nIn most languages the word just relates to the color 'black' but in US English it's a word you really should not say out loud. It's one of the very few words that have been socially 'retired' because it's usage was so negative that we have simply stopped using it.\n\nYou occasionally hear two black men use the word for each other in a casual way,  but even that usage seems to be diminishing; but that is the only time you should ever hear the word in regular life.

      "You're correct. A question should be  ordered like \"when will \\[the food\\] be \\[ready\\]\". A statement should be ordered like \"\\[the movie\\] will be \\[over\\] \\[soon\\]\". Maybe autocorrection is assuming you are trying to write part of a sentence, like \"I don't know when \\[the moon\\] will be \\[out\\].\"\n\nFor a lot of statements I would not say will be like I wouldnt say \"When we'll be on vacation....\" or \"I hope that when I'll be 65....\" I would say \"we're\"/\"I'm\"",

Normal speakers just say “when it snows”.",
      "The order changes the meaning of the question. Your examples are correct if you wanna know when something will be happening... a day, time, season, etc. The other ordering is usually for when you are going to add a point to it at the end like...\n\n*When men will be away, the wives will play.*\n\nBut this is honestly terrible English and I would never speak this way.",
      "I don’t know about English learning apps, but you should know that autocorrect on phone keyboards has been getting worse and less accurate. Even things have like Grammarly and Microsoft Word’s Grammar Check have started suggesting incorrect word alternatives and incorrect grammar to me, and they used to be very reliable!\n\nFor example, I typed, “Sara played the song and it pleased John.” But my phone’s autocorrect changed it to, “Sara played the song and it *pleases* John.” Autocorrect’s change is technically a grammatically-correct sentence, but because it changed the verb tense, it’s changed the *meaning* of my sentence to something I didn’t intend and is not accurate. I’ve also seen autocorrect change things like, “of course,” to, “if corpse.” If and corpse are spelled correctly, but the change doesn’t make sense at all.\n\nAll of that to say, don’t trust your phone or writing apps to correct your grammar. It’s smart to double check with your textbooks, or English-speaking friends, or Reddit like you did here. Asking here shows that you’re clearly doing well and learning to recognize what sounds right and what doesn’t in English. Good job!\n\nAnd it just tried to change, “Asking here shows…” to, “Asking her shoes…”",

      "1. Agreed but there is still some nuance here. A native speaker might break up a contraction for emphasis (\"No, I did *not*\" instead of \"No I didn't\") and it's common to avoid them in very formal writing.\n2. In casual conversation with someone you're familiar with this is true. Using these when you're trying to be polite like if you were speaking with a stranger or your superior might come off as rude. Because native speakers would absolutely say \"Can you please tell me...\" (or similar) in some situations.\n3. Is this just saying don't pause between words? Never heard it called linking but that's what it sounds like...which I guess is true, we tend to just flow from one word to the next in normal conversation.\n4. Not all these are filler phrases in that example...\"kind of\" and \"sort of\" are just descriptors you don't just say them as filler. \"Ya know\" is and to a lesser extent \"I mean\" is as well. But the overall point is correct, filler phrases and hesitation words like \"um\" \"uh\" and \"like\" are an important part of English.\n5. This is very true.

For example, in the US the federal government receives taxes and distributes part of that back to each state to help with operating schools. But each state sets their own curriculum, school calendars, each state has its own standards for certifying and disciplining teachers, and so on. There is the federal government, and the state governments, and neither has full control. The powers and responsibilities are separated.\n\nWhat Ramaswamy is trying to \"say\" is that he thinks the federal government in DC has too much power and that the states have too little, and in his opinion federalism (the division of responsibilities) has become too lopsided, and that if he is elected to be governor he will try to reclaim some of those state's powers that he thinks have been diluted or lost.\n\n(Note: whether he is correct on the facts is another matter, but this thread is not the place for that kind of argument; he is like many politicians in that he says a lot of things, but has only an intermittent relationship with facts - and in an opinion statement like this it is simply not possible to prove him fully right or fully wrong, and the ensuing argument would be very messy and require a lot of historical background)",

Of course, one of Vivek's goals probably is to promote the Republican party so you likely aren't wrong he wants that, but this is likely referring to a specific state bill that was just signed into law that he's touting as his and Ohio's achievement and calling other states to copy it.",

    "text": "",
    "comments": [
      "In every day usage, you can climb up, down, or even side to side. However, if you leave off the \"up,\" people will usually assume you're climbing up (as in \"to climb a ladder\").\n\nIn an airplane, climbing only refers to going up in elevation, so the \"up\" isn't necessary.",
      "“Climb” by itself is more general. “Climb up” is specifically climbing *up*. \n\nI’m not sure I understand the second question, but I’ll try to answer it anyway. If you said that an aircraft was climbing, I would interpret that as the aircraft is steadily flying higher. Saying “the aircraft was climbing up” sounds off to me and I would never say it. The only thing I might add is an altitude, for example “the aircraft climbed to 20,000 feet” or something like that.",
      "They are pretty much interchangeable. Climb the stairs, climb up the stairs. Both are correct.\n\nIf there is no object and the usage is simply 'Ciimb.' it just means 'go higher'\n\n'The plane/temperature/volume climbs'",
      "I don't think there's much difference in meaning. Possibly there is some difference in register with 'climb' sounding a little more formal and 'climb up' a little less so and more day-to-day, but it's a very subtle difference. Newsreaders would probably use 'climb'. \n\nIf I try out sentences in my head then my brain definitely wants to add 'up' to 'the monkey climbs to its branch in the tree' but the biggest thing that 'up' changes if I add it isn't meaning or register but where the sentence stress falls. If I don't add 'up', then 'climbs' carries a lot more stress. If I instead say 'the monkey climbs up to its branch in the tree' the stress falls clearly on 'up' and the sentence (in my opinion) seems to flow better and feels nicer to say.\n\nUsing 'up' or not after 'climb' isn't ever something I would consciously think about, so  my guess is that there isn't a significant difference but rather one of quite subtle differences in style, accent and ease of pronunciation.  \n\nThinking about your example, I can say either 'the pilot climbed to 20000 feet' or 'the pilot climbed up to 20000 feet'' and the meaning is clear and identical in both. However if I use 'up' I am (slightly) expecting a second clause to follow, again I think because of how the rhythm and stress falls. But adding a second clause wouldn't be wrong without 'up' and likewise it wouldn't be wrong to not have a second clause if you use 'up'. These are subtle feelings. \n\nIn general terms, when you get a long answer like this and native speakers aren't immediately sure without having to think hard about exactly how they use a word then the answer is often  'style'. And especially so when the opinions vary, as style and register are extremely variable between different English dialects.\n\nTl;dr: either 'climb' or 'climb up' are fine to use based on your personal preference.",
      "Climb and climb up are essentially two ways to mean the same thing. Climb and climb up both mean to increase elevation. So someone may want to climb up a ladder or climb a ladder to go up to somewhere higher than where they are currently positioned at.",
      "OK, this is my impression, as a native English speaker in the US:\n\nAn airplane climbs to achieve its altitude. People can climb a tree, climb a ladder, and so on. Usually, when I think climb up I'm thinking of stepping on something and alternating feet to step or proceed upward. We \"climb up into the attic\" by pulling down the folding stairs tucked up into the ceiling. Then we climb that ladder. Or we climb up that ladder. Hell, it really doesn't matter",
      "In normal conversation, I’d say there’s not much of a distinction between “climb” and “climb up”. Perhaps with “climb” there’s a bit of ambiguity on direction as you could be climbing horizontally as opposed to the singular verticality of “climb up”.\n\nWith aircraft, I know that the word “climb” is used to describe the action of a plane pitching up and gaining elevation. I am unsure if “climb up” is used at all in aviation terms specifically.",
      "Yeah nail on the head. I feel most people would use “ascend” and “descend” for aircraft anyway though",
      "You’re right, yeah, ascend and descend are the words I’d expect to hear in a sentence with aircraft. I imagine more technical sounding words are usually used together"

My tongue ends up in a roughly neutral position but with the mid-tongue supported by my back teeth. I believe (but don’t know for sure) that the click language of Africa use similar movements to create their ‘click’ phonemes.\n\nA cluck is a similar action, but the tongue ends up down in the bottom of the mouth, and the mouth is open, so the sound is louder and deeper in tone.\n\nAs someone else said, a cluck is used specifically for chickens, but if you asked me to cluck like a chicken, that is how I would make the sound",
      "I’ve never heard of “clucking your tongue”. In my dialect, the sound you described is called “sucking (one’s) teeth”, but this is far from universal. A lot of people call this tisking or tsking, but that’s a different (quieter) sound for me.",

Geena Davis plays a dog trainer with a world-class tongue click.\n\nBoth expressions refer to a noise made with the tongue, not a facial expression.\n\nCongratulations, by the way, on the sophistication of your English: not a lot of native speakers routinely run into either of these expressions, as they are no longer in common use.

    "title": "Why \"Did You Want a Coffee?\" Sounds Polite — And Why Many Explanations Get It Wrong",
    "text": "# 1️⃣ Introduction: The Strange Politeness of \"Did You Want a Coffee?\"\n\n*\"Did you want a coffee?\"* — at first glance, this question looks odd.  \nThe person is asking now, but the verb is in the past tense. Why?\n\nIn English, this form of polite question is very common, especially in places like cafés, restaurants, and casual conversations.  \nBut why does using a past tense sound polite?  \nAnd why do so many explanations about this seem unsatisfying?\n\nIn this post, I will examine the logic behind this phenomenon and show why the past tense works as an effective politeness strategy.\n\n*Note: For those interested in a more detailed, linguistically focused version of this topic (including cross-linguistic comparisons), a companion post will be available soon.*\n\n# 2️⃣ The Usual Explanations — And Their Problems\n\nEnglish learners are often told that the past tense here \"**creates psychological distance**,\" making the request sound softer.  \nOr they hear that \"**the past tense here doesn't mean past time**\" — it's just a politeness marker.\n\nBut these explanations have serious flaws:\n\n* They suggest that \"**time and politeness**\" are completely unrelated, which is misleading.\n* They often fail to explain why \"**could**\" and \"**would**\" actually feel more polite than \"**can**\" and \"**will**\".\n* They don't account for why \"**Did you want...?**\" is preferred in certain contexts but sounds strange in others.\n\nClearly, there's more going on.\n\n# 3️⃣ A Better Explanation: Temporal Framing and Cognitive Pacing\n\nHere's a more useful way to understand this phenomenon.\n\nWhen we use *Did you want...?* or *Would you...?*, we are not simply being indirect.  \nWe are subtly shaping the **temporal frame** of the interaction.\n\nBy putting the question in the past tense, the speaker does two things:\n\n1️⃣ Signals that the request is **not sudden** — it may have been thought about or assumed earlier.  \n2️⃣ Gives the listener **time to consider their response** — they don't feel immediate pressure.\n\nThis is related to **cognitive pacing**:  \nA well-paced question gives the other person **mental space** to reflect, which increases comfort and politeness.\n\n# 4️⃣ Real-life Examples\n\nCompare:\n\n* *Will you have a coffee?* → sounds like a request **right now**, can feel pushy.\n* *Would you like a coffee?* → softer, gives more time to think.\n* *Did you want a coffee?* → adds another layer — suggests that perhaps the listener had already been considering this, reducing pressure even further.\n\nIn real conversations, this subtle shift makes a big difference.  \nIt also allows for **easy rejection** without awkwardness:\n\n*\"No, I didn't.\"* → socially smooth.  \n*\"No, I don't.\"* → feels more abrupt.\n\n# 5️⃣ Cross-cultural Perspective\n\nOther languages handle this politeness-time relationship differently.\n\n* Korean and Japanese often use **sentence pacing and phrase delaying** rather than tense shifts.\n* Spanish and Italian sometimes use **conditional forms**.\n* In English, **past tense framing** is a highly effective and well-accepted strategy.\n\nThis shows that **politeness and time framing are deeply connected**, but each language implements this differently.\n\n# 6️⃣ Common Misunderstandings to Avoid\n\n* \"**The past tense here has nothing to do with time**\" → False. It does — it frames the **social time** of the request.\n* \"**It's just psychological distance**\" → Too vague. The more precise effect is about **temporal pacing and response management**.\n* \"**You must always use it**\" → No. Context matters. In formal situations, *Would you...?* is often better. With friends, *Do you want...?* may be perfectly fine.\n\n# 7️⃣ Conclusion\n\nWhen used well, *Did you want...?* is not an odd grammatical error — it's a **powerful tool** for managing politeness and social flow.\n\nIt works because it:\n\n* Frames the request in a **non-immediate temporal space**.\n* Gives the listener **processing time**.\n* Provides an **easy out** if they wish to decline.\n\nIn other words:  \nIt uses **temporal framing** to create **social comfort** — which is one of the core functions of politeness itself.\n\n\n\n*Note: I am not a linguist nor an expert in English education. The following analysis reflects an independent reasoning process based on publicly observable usage and cognitive principles. Given that similar ideas may have been explored elsewhere, this post does not claim originality but aims to contribute to the ongoing discussion in a transparent manner.

The meaning “accomplish”, as in DO SOMETHING, is secondary. So we would rather use another verb, like “work”, in this context.\n\n“John talks more than he does”, with the stress on “does”, is kind of natural. “John does more than he talks” sounds *really* weird because the beginning of the sentence sets up DO as a full verb, which is transitive unlike TALK - then you read DO MORE as a transitive verb + object, which leads to a classic garden path sentence. You could say “John prefers doing to talking” to neutralise the verb and that would be more sensible. But this is such a fine point of English grammar that I’d try to avoid using DO in this context.",

John talks more than he does.\n\nIn this case, \"he\" refers to George, but it is still ambiguous because technically it can refer to John. \n\nSo the tl;dr is the \"than he/she does\" pattern is used to compare one person to another. For two actions within a single person, you should say what the other action is instead of the generic \"do.\"",

    "text": "In my native language Dutch we got separate words for sailing with a ship that has real sails and uses only the wind to go forward (zeilen much like the English to sail), and a verb used for to go forward in a boat in general (varen) but that's also translated with to sail.\n\nSo, if I got my motorboat, and go towards a certain place, the motorboat is 'sailing' to .... ?\n\nThere really is no separate word for this? Sailing is what you would commonly also use for ships that have no sails whatsoever? To me that seems kind of odd. ",
    "comments": [
      "Just be careful about using motorboat as a verb. It can mean, um, a different kind of activity.",
      "In English, *to sail* is often used to refer to the purposeful movement of a ship or boat regardless of its means of propulsion. So it would be reasonable for me to say that my father-in-law sailed all over the Pacific when he was in the navy, even though his ship was nuclear-powered. Or that the ferry has a sailing time of 10:30 am, even though the ferry isn't a sailing vessel.\n\nBut you can also use some terms based on the means of propulsion: a steamship *steams*, a sailboat *sails*, a motorboat *motors*. This can be quite significant when a vessel has multiple means of propulsion, such as a sailing yacht that also has a motor.",
      "I would say 'boating'! Sailing is for ships with sails, boating is for ships with motors, rowing is for using oars. But if someone described a large cargo ship with engines as 'sailing' to another country, it wouldn't sound weird. I typically hear boating with small ships.\n\nETA: For instance, in the state of California, operating any recreational motorized vehicle requires a boater card.",
      "Correct. But it’s fuzzy. \n\nFor private pleasure boats we normally say we’re going out on Dave’s boat, or going boating, and if Dave’s boat is a sailboat then we’re going sailing with Dave. For small vessels that still might be sail powered, that distinction exists. \n\nBut if you’re going out on a giant diesel powered cruise ship? Yeah we can still say we set sail on Thursday. Even though zero actual sails are set. The crew on a boat or ship are still called sailors. And diesel powered cargo ships sail across the ocean. We still say that, even though they haven’t been sail powered for well over a century. \n\nWe say sailing for powered boats the same way we say filming for video recording, or taping for audio recording. There are new words but we keep using the old ones. So if you’re actually sailing with wind power you sometimes need to use extra words to explain that.",
      "For a small motorboat, I would use either \"drive the boat\" or \"take the boat.\" \"Boating\" to me implies a leisure activity.\n\nIn terms of describing the skill, I would use drive. \"Can you drive a boat?\" \"I'm teaching him to drive the boat.\" \n\nDay to day use, I think I would use \"take.\" \"I'm taking the boat to the island this afternoon.\" \"I'll take you out on the boat to show you the best fishing spots.\" Occasionally I might say drive as well. \"Jason Statham drove the boat right between two gondolas.\"",
      "It is a bit odd to use sail without sails, but there aren’t that many options.\n\nYou can use *cruise* for some meanings of varen/vaart (both verb and noun).",
      "Well, there's a lot to unpack here.\n\nThe voyage itself is always sailing. \"The ship turned on its engines and sailed to its distant destination.\"\n\nHow the ship moves will be referred to with the method: sailing, rowing, or motoring. \"The small boat rowed across the pond.\" \"The ferry motored its way across the harbor.\" \"The sailboat sailed up and down the beach.\"\n\nThen there is the operation of said boat. That can vary wildly based on the size and type of ship. You aren't the \"driver\" of a giant cargo ship, you are a \"helmsman.\" Things like that.",
      "I've always driven motorboats and sailed sailboats. And rowed a rowboat, but I try to avoid that. That's in the US. \n\n\nI've occasionally heard people talking about sailing a motorboat, but not usually from someone who actually spends time on boats. ",
      "There is no specific word for traveling to a place in a water vehicle which does not have sails. It's still sailing. A crew member on a ship (any ship) is still a sailor.",
      "BrEng - there's not really a direct translation for 'varen', and if someone said \"I'm sailing to Hoek van Holland from Harwich\" then I'd assume that they were taking the ferry or another type of powered craft, not getting into a sailing boat! It's probably more common to say \"I'm _taking_ the ferry\" (equivalent to \"ik ga met de veerboot\") or \"I'm going on a speedboat\" as a phrase. \nWe also use the phrase \"to set sail\" to mean 'to get a boat journey underway' (is there a similar phrase in Dutch?)",
      "There used to be comparable words in English. Terms like “motoring”, “cruising”, and “steaming” all were used like you are describing. Today though, so few people are familiar with any kind of maritime activities, that yeah “sailing” is pretty much a catch-all term. \n\nAlso, keep in mind that the Netherlands are culturally really really intense when it comes to boats.",
      "I have sailed a sailboat, paddled a kayak and a canoe, and driven a powerboat. Looking forward to being back on the water next week.",
      "And be careful looking up boating terminology - most English speakers won't know technical terms, or even nautical basics like port vs. starboard (because why would they?)",
      "For a big sailboat that has a motor and sales and uses the motor only rarely I would say that it is \"motoring\" into its slip if it were going there without its sail power.",

      "Well, speaking of course. When you listen to something, or read something you can basically understand anything that someone's saying even if you don't perfectly know the grammar, by just literally translating the words used in the sentence.

Honing each skill might have a different sequence.\n\nReading is the easiest because once you remember enough words you can sort of understand written materials, even if you don’t understand much about grammar.\n\nThen comes writing. Although both writing and speaking are “creation”, writing gives you more time to think. Plus looking at the words simultaneously actually helps you write because you can look at the text as a whole.\n\nNext would be speaking, without visual aid makes it harder to generate the right words. And in reality you use less time to speak, and that means you have less time to think and generate next word. And you just cannot delete the previous word like in writing.\n\nI put listening at last because like speaking you have less time to process, but unlike speaking you have no control of the content being said. Reading and listening are both “reception”, but unlike reading, words are connected in natural conversations. You need certain level of knowledge and experience in that language to be able to know where to separate the words. And sometimes words are omitted. “Why did you lie” vs “why july”.\n\nPersonal opinion.",

I see something flying. Therefore, that thing must be a bird.\n\nThat is an assumption made *a priori* (a deduction or conclusion drawn from information I already knew prior to this moment, rather than a conclusion I developed by trying to find out whether birds are truly the only things that fly).\n\nThe term is used in philosophy and law, academics, etc. in order to help someone identify the reason one idea is weak or another idea is strong. If I published a research article about thousands of birds in my garden, and cited my experience as described above, another scientist (or lawyer, etc) would publish a counter-argument pointing out that insects fly, airplanes fly, and so on. And that while I saw things flying, my statement (that there are thousands of birds at my house) has insufficient information, and that I forgot to explain why *only* birds and not other possibilities should be considered as a valid observation.\n\nThey would make me go back and examine a percentage of the flying things, noting the material and size, the habit or movement, and other details which could contribute to \"proving\" that I had thousands of birds at my house rather than thousands of insects or thousands of airplanes; and that most likely I was seeing thousands of *insects* because they are small, and thousands *could* fit on my property while birds and airplanes are quite large, and would probably *not* fit on my property unless I owned an entire estate.\n\nIn other words, they would point out that I made an *a priori* assumption (based on prior experience) but in order to prove my point, I need to provide *a posteriori* discussion. *Posteriori* meaning something like \"information collected in addition to what is already known\". They might give me some guides to airplanes, birds, and insects, and ask me to find images of the things flying around my property. Maybe I need to capture one, or sketch an image (or take a video). Maybe I watch for them to drop something, and I go pick up the dropped object and include it with my report. Did the things drop feathers? Or scales? Or metal bits?\n\n  \nAnyway.

      "There's already a much better tool for this called yomitan. It was built for japanese but it works for every language as long as you import a dictionary for it. It even includes one-click Anki imports.\n\n\nAs for pacing issues when consuming content, you have to be able to split your watch time into 2 distinct categories. One where you look up every word you don't know and add it to your flash cards, and a second where you just accept that you're going to miss words.\n\n\nIf you're not mining unknown word to put into a spaced repetition flash card deck (Anki) then the first one isn't worth doing IMO. You'll learn your target language much slower though.\n\n\nI highly recommend watching YouTube videos about language learning, specifically Japanese as those are the most popular and well made resources.",
      "I understand that people want to hide subtitles to better focus on the spoken dialogue. That's perfectly valid, and  initialIy I thought you're talking about this problem. Thought you can obviously just turn them off on youtube, so that was a bit puzzling.\n\nBut instead it turns out you're just too lazy to read the subtitles and want AI to read them for you. I don't know man, I can understand a lot but this just sounds fucking stupid to me.",
      "Hey everyone! 👋\n\nSo I've been struggling with a common problem: I can read English subtitles perfectly, but when I turn them off, I miss half of what's being said. Reading text and understanding spoken English are completely different skills - your brain gets used to processing words visually instead of training your ears.\n\n**What I built:** A Chrome extension that adds a floating mic button to YouTube videos. When you miss something while listening (no subtitles), you can ask \"what did they just say?\" or \"what does that word mean?\" and get instant voice responses based on the video context.\n\nI tested it watching The Big Bang Theory without subtitles and it actually worked great - like having a language tutor next to you who can rewind and explain things.\n\n**The goal:** Train your ears to understand spoken English, not just your eyes to read text. Pure listening + AI help when you're stuck = faster progress toward real comprehension.\n\n**Thought this might help other English learners too?** Would love feedback on whether this approach makes sense.\n\nThe extension is free, but you'll need your own OpenAI API key (about $0.007 per question).\n\nGitHub: [https://github.com/SkyJinXX/WatchBuddy](https://github.com/SkyJinXX/WatchBuddy)\n\nWould love to hear your thoughts!",
      "Thanks for mentioning Yomitan! I might not have explained clearly - WatchBuddy is different from dictionary tools. It's more like having an AI conversation about real-time video content - you can ask \"what did they just say?\" or \"explain that concept\" and it understands the video context and timing.\n\nDifferent tools for different needs! 😊",
      "I think there's a misunderstanding. Reading subtitles and understanding spoken dialogue are completely different skills.\n\nWhen you rely on reading, your brain gets used to processing text instead of training your ear to catch the actual sounds, rhythm, and pronunciation. Pure listening forces you to develop real auditory comprehension.\n\nTry watching something without subtitles for a bit and you'll feel the difference.\n\nDifferent methods work for different people though! 🤷‍♂️"

This may be a bit childish for you, seeing this post’s level of English, but you should try one nevertheless.\n\n2.

Harry Potter by J. K. Rowling. I don’t think this series really needs an introduction.\n\n4. This is an obscure one, it’s young adult fantasy/romance. Seems a bit weird, but it’s amazing, trust me. The Seven Realms Series, by Cinda Williams Chima. This series is so good I’ve reread it more times than I can count.\n\nHM: Eragon by Christopher Paolini.

I’ve tried quite a few things that really helped me (and are mostly free), like:\n\nBooks and print resources: English Vocabulary in Use (Cambridge): From Elementary to Advanced, with clear explanations and practice exercises. Oxford Word Skills: Very practical vocabulary organized by level and topic. Collins COBUILD Dictionary: Designed for learners, with full-sentence examples. Also available online.\n\nThere are also apps I find very helpful, like Anki with spaced repetition flashcards. You can find lots of English decks or make your own. Memrise – Helps you learn with short videos of native speakers. Quizlet offers flashcard-based app with vocabulary lists created by learners and teachers. Duolingo is good for beginners to build a foundation in vocabulary and grammar. WordUp focuses on real-life vocabulary from movies, books, and news.\n\nAlso, you might like FluentU – It uses short video clips (from movies, interviews, etc.) to teach real-world English. You get interactive subtitles, definitions, and examples in context. I help them with some admin tasks, and I really like how learner-friendly and practical it is — especially for picking up expressions and natural phrasing.\n\nI'd also recommend reading graded readers (books written for learners), and watch your favorite shows with English subtitles first, then try without. It builds both your vocabulary and listening over time without feeling too heavy.",
      "Hi, \nAs an English tutor based in India, I understand the challenges you're currently facing in your learning journey. \n\nFor improving vocabulary, there's nothing better than reading consistently. Check out books by Ruskin Bond, R.K Narayan and Khyrunnisa A. Their writings are set in India, easy to follow and are filled with a rich vocabulary and idiomatic expressions. Re-read them again and do a weekly challenge of learning 5 new words everyday. This is something that I do with my students and has shown good results. \n\nAs for the dictionaries, you can follow the Oxford Advanced Learner's Dictionary among other apps which commonly come with images and examples. \n\nFor the accent part, I would ask you to focus on neutralizing your Indian accent rather than learning a new one. That should be sufficient.\nYou can DM if you want more help.",

I can say I feel as confident speaking English to people as I'd feel talking in my native language (to be fair, I'm not a confident speaker overall, but it's not a language issue, it's a social anxiety issue haha) . However, when I join a meeting (especially an informal one) with natives only, especially youngsters, I do feel left behind. I feel like I'm lacking that cultural background they have and oftentimes I can't contribute to their conversations. Having said all of this, I think my English requires some touching-up to do, and I still constantly learn new vocabulary and revise grammar rules.",

Especially for the sounds that are difficult when coming from my native language.  \n(I think I just watched shows and videos in English and tried to imitate how they said things)\n\nNow people mistake me for being British from time to time so I'll count that as a success."

Especially when I’m talking to native speakers.\n\nAt some point, Duolingo started feeling more like playing a game than actually learning. The dopamine hits are real, but am I really getting better? I don't think so.\n\nDon’t get me wrong, it’s fun and probably great for total beginners. But as someone who’s more intermediate now, I’m starting to feel like it’s not really helping me move toward fluency.\n\nI’ve been digging through language subreddits and saw many recommending [italki ](https://go.italki.com/rtsgeneral6)for real language learning, especially if you want to actually speak and get fluent.\n\nI started using it recently and it’s insane how different it is. Just 1-2 sessions a week with a tutor pushed me to speak, make mistakes, and actually improve. I couldn’t hide behind multiple choice anymore. Having to speak face-to-face (even virtually) made a huge difference for me and I’m already feeling more confident.\n\nAnyone else go through something like this?\n\nIs Duolingo a good way to actually learn a language or just a fun little distraction that deludes us into thinking we're learning?",
    "comments": [
      "Duolingo, as you point out, IS a game. But it's not just an illusion of learning. It is still a tool for learning, albeit not a very good one. I think the problem comes down to a disconnect in expectations. Duolingo is not going to make anyone fluent in any language, but a lot of people seem to think it is. And don't get me wrong, Duolingo encourages that belief, or at least doesn't do much of anything to discourage it. But I personally will always defend Duolingo, and I firmly believe it is a net-positive. If someone is serious about language learning, they may start with Duolingo but eventually they'll have the same realization that you're having now, and move on to better methods. And if they're not serious about language learning, the alternative is probably some other shovelware game on their phone that doesn't teach them anything. I know from my own experience that my mother-in-law used to spend hours playing Candy Crush, and now she spends that time playing French Duolingo. She still doesn't speak much French, but she definitely wasn't learning anything from Candy Crush. I think what's indisputable is that Duolingo has made a lot more people interested in learning languages who may not have been otherwise, and for that reason I think it's wonderful.",
      "I have a streak of over 5 years in Duolingo now. I would never use it expecting to reach fluency from it, but I think it helps to keep slightly warm languages you have to put on the backburner. I occasionally learn something new, often forget it, but it's a starting point.\n\n\nI think that much depends also on how close your target language is to languages you already speak. Like, learning Chinese from scratch as someone who speaks only English is one thing, keeping Dutch warm as someone who speaks German is another.",
      "It's an okay way to dip your toes into learning a new language, or to supplement learning, but anyone who thinks they are truly learning a language by just doing Duolingo is deluding themselves, yes.\n\nI have tried it  a few times in the past as a way to introduce myself to a language, before actually devoting more time and effort into learning it properly. Personally I find it gets tedious as hell after a week or two and I don't know how anyone finds it engaging enough to actually completely the tree or whatever it's called - I consider that a huge waste of time.\n\n(also, I think they are ethically reprehensible as a company and would never support them again, so there's that)",

My vocabulary and conversations are noticeably better as my trip goes on and keeping the target language in my head works - at least for me.\n\n  \nJust practicing on the program in a language vacuum without the extra fluency gained from interacting with people is probably limited in it's usefulness but it depends on your goals.  For me the #1 goal is conversational fluency - not written or near correct grammar.",

I'm able to talk to Spanish-only speakers now, and I understand better what Spanish DJs say on the radio. Duo is a tool but it can't do it all for you. Practice, practice, practice.",
      "If we get past all the personal feeling about their promotion and gamification functionality, Duolingo is a very good product. But it is important to have realistic expectations.\n\nThere is active and passive learnings. Active learning happens in class, learning rules and making intentional things to get knowledge. It is crucial and important part of learning. And teachers also emphasise that off-class drills and repetition is as important. Because person cannot learn a language taking 2 classes a day.\n\nConsistent and repetitive exposure to language is as if not more important. This is where Duolingo steps is. It is a great app for exposure, drills and repetition. Its limitations are that one can develop a language with it up to A2 level and maintain B1-B2 level if needed. If you expect that Duolingo will help support your development to A2 and maintain your B1-B2, it's a great product.\n\nOne crucial thing about all apps, not only Duolingo is that you learn language to communicate with humans. No app and nothing except communication with humans can help you learn to communicate with humans. It is not reasonable to expect that from an app.",
      "I haven't used DL in years so take this with a grain of salt, it's based on my experience with it when I was early in my Spanish learning journey over a decade ago:\n\nDuoLingo is a good learning tool, but NOT on its own. You NEED to supplement it with other things like studying vocab and grammar rules directly, focused media consumption in target language, and conversation practice with real people whenever and wherever you can get it.",

It’s not about erasing your identity or just mimicking native speakers — at least not the way good coaching is done.\n\nI recently put together a short educational video (my first!) explaining how accent training actually works: the core techniques (like retraining muscle memory, mastering rhythm and stress, etc.), why apps often fall short, and what a structured process looks like if you’re trying to speak more clearly and naturally.\n\nIf you’ve ever been curious about what goes into changing how you sound in English — or whether it’s even possible — this might give you a clearer picture:\n\n👉 [https://youtu.be/nr61UmnEBrw](https://youtu.be/nr61UmnEBrw)\n\nHope it helps someone out there!

    "comments": [
      "“Obligingly” is the adverb form of the verb “oblige,” or “obliging”. “Oblige” just means to do what someone wants you to do.\n\nHe is obliging by yawning after being told to sleep.",
      "I think this may be translated into English, making it not as natural sounding as it may be in its original language. \n\nFor me, a better use of “obligingly” would be: \n\n“Get out of my way,” he said. \n\nShe stepped aside, obligingly.\n\nSo the second person is doing what the first person wanted them to so (step aside).",
      "He's \"obliging\" the sleep suggestion made by Zhang Yuwen by yawning, indicating sleepiness. To \"oblige\" in this sense is to do or experience something which agrees with some recently-mentioned expectation or another. Two examples:  \n  \nExample 1: \"I wish I hadn't dropped my sandwich,\" Karen said. \"I'm starving.\"   \nObligingly, Steve offered her half of his own.   \n(Note the fact that there was not a real, legal-or-otherwise obligation to do anything in this situation and it's just about \"being obliging\" which is another way of describing behaving empathetically).\n\nExample 2: \"How many kids do you have again? Is it two?\" I asked just before her two children walked obligingly down the stairs.  \n(Again, there was no direct obligation on the kids to do anything - in this case it just described a situation which happened serendipitously, which is to say \"fittingly\" or \"luckily\" for that moment.)\n\nSo it's not really about an existing obligation; it's really just meant to indicate that something just said, or asked, or which is otherwise somehow recently relevant, has been answered or addressed in a way suited to the question/comment. I hope that helps.",
      "It means to do something in agreement to what is being asked. So in this context the yawn is agreeing to the fact that they do indeed need some sleep",
      "What confused you about the dictionary definition? It would be easier to help if we had a starting point. ",
      "It’s a little bit odd stylistically. Presumably Zhang Yuwen doesn’t specifically *want* him to yawn. “As if on cue” would be better.",

      "oooh! great example, thanks. Yes, this is precisely a translation from mandarin",
      "this helped a ton! tysm!",
      "i know the dictionary definition, but this context caught me off guard bc the previous dialogue says “you’ll be fine after some sleep” and the other person immediately yawns but continues the conversation with another question instead of ending their meeting to go sleep \n\nmight be my reading comprehension tho",
      "interesting point, it does sound a little better that way now that i think about it, thanks!",
      "The yawn is corroborating the assertion that he's tired, that's why is obliging. Although this is a translation, I assume the original harem novel is in mandarin. ",

    "comments": [
      "So, to give an answer one step beyond “because”- modern English has -s in 3rd person singular because older versions of English had -eth (he runneth, thus sayeth the Lord, etc.) and this has had a phoneme shift to -s. Meanwhile the second person singular -est  (thou makest, thou thinkest, etc.) just got dropped entirely, as English now uses the “you” form ( which was previously just plural/formal) for everything.",
      "Because that's the conjugation. Other languages have more complicated conjugation schemes, and some languages have multiple independent schemes.",
      "A verb like \"to steal\" used to be conjugated: ic \\[I\\] *stel****e***, þū \\[thou\\] *stil****st***, hē/hēo/hit \\[he/she/it\\] *stil****þ*** ... with different endings (!), but the \"þū/thou\" form got (mostly) dropped, and the other forms just became \"steal\".\n\n\"Stilþ\", on the other hand, evolved to \"stealeth\" and finally to \"steals\".\n\nThere are lots of dialects of English today that leave off this \"-s\", and have different ways of conjugating and showing tense, so who knows what the future holds for English in general.",
      "It’s a vestigial component of what used to be a complex system of verb morphology. \n\n**Old English**\n\n|Infinitive|tacan (\"[to] take\")|\n:--|:--|\n|First-person singular (≈ I)|tace|\n|Second-person singular (≈ Thou)|tæcst|\n|Third-person singular (≈ He/She/It)|tæcþ|\n|Plural (≈ We/You/They)|tacaþ|\n\n**Middle English**\n\n|Infinitive|taken (\"[to] take\")|\n:--|:--|\n|First-person singular (≈ I)|take|\n|Second-person singular (≈ Thou)|takest|\n|Third-person singular (≈ He/She/It)|taketh|\n|Plural (≈ We/You/They)|take **or** taken|\n\n**Modern English**\n\n|Infinitive|[to] take|\n:--|:--|\n|First-person singular (≈ I)|take|\n|Second-person singular (≈ Thou)|[replaced by formerly plural “you”]|\n|Third-person singular (≈ He/She/It)|takes|\n|Plural (≈ We/You/They)|take|\n\nEnglish, as part of a common trend in Western and Northern European languages, has become increasingly **analytic** over the centuries, which means we depend less on changing the form of words to mark grammatical relationships and instead rely on word order and function words. English (plus the Scandinavian languages) kind of stands at the “vanguard” of this change, in part due to the way English has interacted with the languages around it (esp. Scandinavian and Celtic languages and French).\n\nThe “-s” will probably disappear as well. It already has in some colloquial dialects.",
      "Because that's the suffix that's used for the third person singular?",
      "Because it tells us that the verb is third person singular. 🙂\n\n\nRedundancy makes languages easier to understand (for fluent speakers), because even if you miss a word or syllable, there are other clues to help you figure out what the other person said.",
      "Old English lufaþ, Modern English loves, Modern German liebt.\n\nMaybe a linguist out there can explain why my ancestors went from 'th' to 's' and where the German 't' came from: was it from 'th' as well?",
      "Because Vikings and French people are stupid and can’t learn how to properly conjugate verbs in a foreign language apparently",
      "Does your language not have conjugation? ",
      "Thou hast said it",
      "The German and English share an ancestor in Proto-West Germanic \\**lubōn* (which itself is a denominal verb). The third-person singular did indeed have the “th” /θ/ sound: \\**lubōþ*.\n\nIt’s not unusual for the sounds /θ/ and /ð/ to disappear, reappear, and get changed—they’re difficult and rare sounds. Compare the modern phenomena of [th-stopping](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Th-stopping) (“brother” -> “brudder”) and [th-fronting](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Th-fronting) (“brother” -> “bruvver”).\n\nOld High German had already developed its modern ending in *lubōt* (= loves) and had lost /θ/ altogether by 900 CE in favor of /d/ and /t/.\n\nThe English case is more complex. It could be mere simplification, especially in consonant clusters and then by analogy throughout the whole system, but this is problematic because that change is reflected nowhere else in English grammar, which retains /θ/ in complex consonant clusters (e.g. “strengths,” “fifths”). \n\nA more coherent but roundabout hypothesis posits that it’s due to migration from Northern Germanic-speaking populations (which, for example, also introduced the pronoun “they”). Because the second- and third-person singular verb forms are/were identical in their language(s), it’s thought that they may have generalized the second-person form (“-st”) as second-language speakers of (Middle/Early Modern) English and thus transferred the /s/. The ending then underwent some series of changes to again differentiate it (i.e. dropping the /t/).\n\nIn any case, we know that by the time of Shakespeare (Early Modern English), both forms were in robust use.",
